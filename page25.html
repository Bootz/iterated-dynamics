  Pause and increase the red, green, or blue component of all colors by a

  ALTERN.MAP, supplied with the program.

  &lt;S&gt;
  Pause, prompt for a filename, and save the current palette to the named
  file (.MAP assumed).  See Palette Maps (p. 88).


 1.5 Palette Editing Commands

  Palette-editing mode provides a number of tools for modifying the colors
  in an image.  It can be used only with MCGA or higher adapters, and only
  with 16 or 256 color video modes.  Many thanks to Ethan Nagel for
  creating the palette editor.

  Use the &lt;E&gt; key to enter palette-editing mode from a displayed image or
  from the main menu.

  When this mode is entered, an empty palette frame is displayed. You can
  use the cursor keys to position the frame outline, and &lt;Pageup&gt; and
  &lt;Pagedn&gt; to change its size.  (The upper and lower limits on the size
  depend on the current video mode.)  When the frame is positioned where
  you want it, hit Enter to display the current palette in the frame.

  Note that the palette frame shows R(ed) G(reen) and B(lue) values for
  two color registers at the top.  The active color register has a solid
  frame, the inactive register's frame is dotted.  Within the active
  register, the active color component is framed.

  With a video mode of 640x400 or higher, a status area appears between
  the two color registers.  This status area shows:

    nnn  = color number at the cursor location
    A    = Auto mode
    X, Y = exclusion modes
