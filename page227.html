  New 'exitnoask=yes' commandline/SSTOOLS.INI option to avoid the final
  "are you sure?" screen

  New plasma-cloud options.  The interface at the moment (documented here
    and here only because it might change later) lets you:
    - use an alternate drawing algorithm that gives you an earlier preview
      of the finished image.  - re-generate your favorite plasma cloud
    (say, at a higher resolution)
      by forcing a re-select of the random seed.

  New 'N' (negative palette) option from Scott Taylor - the documentation
  at this point is:  Pressing 'N' while in the palette editor will invert
  each color. It will convert only the current color if it is in 'x' mode,
  a range if in 'y' mode, and every color if not in either the 'x' or 'y'
  mode.

  - Speedups:

  New, faster floating-point Mandelbrot/Julia set code from Wesley Loewer,
  Frank Fussenegger and Chris Lusby Taylor (in separate contributions).

  Faster non-386 integer Mandelbrot code from Chris Lusby Taylor, Mike
  Gelvin and Bill Townsend (in separate contributions)

  New integer Lsystems logic from Nicholas Wilt

  Finite-Attractor fixups and Lambda/mandellambda speedups from Kevin
  Allen.

  GIF Decoder speedups from Mike Gelvin

  - Bug-fixes and other enhancements:

  Fractint now works with 8088-based AMSTRAD computers.

  The video logic is improved so that (we think) fewer video boards will
  need "textsafe=save" for correct operation.

  Fixed a bug in the VESA interface which effectively messed up adapters
  with unusual VESA-style access, such as STB's S3 chipset.

  Fixed a color-cycling bug that would at times restore the wrong colors
  to your image if you exited out of color-cycling, displayed a 'help'
  screen, and then returned to the image.

  Fixed the XGA video logic so that its 256-color modes use the same
  default 256 colors as the VGA adapter's 320x200x256 mode.

  Fixed the 3D bug that caused bright spots on surfaces to show as black
  blotches of color 0 when using a light source.

  Fixed an image-generation bug that sometimes caused image regeneration
  to restart even if not required if the image had been zoomed in to the
  point that floating-point had been automatically activated.
