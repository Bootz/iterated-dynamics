  Redoes the undone palette editor commands.

  &lt;F&gt;
  Toggles "Freestyle mode" on and off (Freestyle mode changes a range of
  palette values smoothly from a center value outward).  With your cursor
  inside the palette box, press the &lt;F&gt; key to enter Freestyle mode.  A
  default range of colors will be selected for you centered at the cursor
  (the ends of the color range are noted by putting dashed lines around
  the corresponding palette values). While in Freestyle mode:

   Moving the mouse changes the location of the range of colors that are
   affected.

   Control-Insert/Delete or the shifted-right-mouse-button changes the
   size of the affected palette range.

   The normal color editing keys (R,G,B,1-6, etc) set the central color of
   the affected palette range.

   Pressing ENTER or double-clicking the left mouse button makes the
   palette changes permanent (if you don't perform this step, any palette
   changes disappear when you press the &lt;F&gt; key again to exit freestyle
   mode).

 1.6 Image Save/Restore Commands

  &lt;S&gt; saves the current image to disk. All parameters required to recreate
  the image are saved with it. Progress is marked by colored lines moving
  down the screen's edges.

  The default filename for the first image saved after starting Fractint
  is FRACT001.GIF;  subsequent saves in the same session are automatically
  incremented 002, 003... Use the "savename=" parameter or &lt;X&gt; options
  screen to change the name. By default, files left over from previous
  sessions are not overwritten - the first unused FRACTnnn name is used.
  Use the "overwrite=yes" parameter or &lt;X&gt; options screen) to overwrite
  existing files.

  A save operation can be interrupted by pressing any key. If you
  interrupt, you'll be asked whether to keep or discard the partial file.

  &lt;R&gt; restores an image previously saved with &lt;S&gt;, or an ordinary GIF
  file.  After pressing &lt;R&gt; you are shown the file names in the current
  directory which match the current file mask. To select a file to
  restore, move the cursor to it (or type the first few letters of its
  name) and press &lt;Enter&gt;.

  Directories are shown in the file list with a "\" at the end of the
  name.  When you select a directory, the contents of that directory are
  shown. Or, you can type the name of a different directory (and
  optionally a different drive) and press &lt;Enter&gt; for a new display. You
  can also type a mask such as "*.XYZ" and press &lt;Enter&gt; to display files
