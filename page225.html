   Fractint now looks first any embedded help inside FRACTINT.EXE, and
   then for an external FRACTINT.HLP file before giving up. Previous
   releases required that the help text be embedded inside FRACTINT.EXE.

  Bug fixes:

   Corrected formulas displayed for Marksmandel, Cmplxmarksmandel, and
    associated julia types.

   BTM and precision fixes.

   Symmetry logic changed for various "outside=" options

   Symmetry value for EXP function in lambdafn and lambda(fn||fn) fixed.

   Fixed bug where math errors prevented save in batch mode.

   The &lt;3&gt; and &lt;r&gt; commands no longer destroy image -- user can back out
   with ESC and image is still there.

   Fixed display of correct number of Julibrot parameters, and Julibrot
   relaxes and doesn't constantly force ALTERN.MAP.

   Fixed tesseral type for condition when border is all one color but
   center contains image.

   Fixed integer mandel and julia when used with parameters &gt; +1.99 and &lt;
   -1.99

   Eliminated recalculation when generating a julia type from a mandelbrot
   type when the 'z' screen is viewed for the first time.

   Minor logic change to prevent double-clutching into and out of graphics
   mode when pressing, say, the 'x' key from a menu screen.

   Changed non-US phone number for the Houston Public (Software) Library

   The "Y" screen is now "Extended Options" instead of "Extended Doodads"

   ...and probably a lot more bux-fixes that we've since forgotten that
   we've implemented.


  Version 17.2, 3/92

   - Fixed a bug which caused Fractint to hang when a Continuous Potential
     Bailout value was set (using the 'Y') screen and then the 'Z' screen
     was activated.
   - fixed a bug which caused "batch=yes" runs to abort whenever any
     key was pressed.
   - bug-fixes in the Stereo3D/Targa logic from Marc Reinig.
   - Fractint now works correctly again on FPU-less 8088s when
     zoomed deeply into the Mandelbrot/Julia sets
   - The current image is no longer marked as "not resumable" on a
     Shell-To-Dos ("D") command.
   - fixed a bug which prevented the "help" functions from working
