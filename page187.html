  sets, and consequently an infinite number of finite attractors too.  It
  *MAY* be possible to color in such a lake, by determining the attractor
  for EVERY pixel, but this would probably treble (at least) the number of
  iterations needed to draw the image.  Due to this overhead, Finite
  Attractor logic has not been implemented for Mandel-types.

  Secondly, certain Julia-types with lakes may not respond to this
  treatment, depending on the parameter value used.  E.g., the Lambda Set
  for 0.5 + 0.5i responds well; the Lambda Set for 0.0 + 1.0i does not -
  its lake stays blue.  Attractors that consist of single points, or a
  cycle of a finite number of points are ok.  Others are not.  If you're
  into fractal technospeak, the implemented approach fails if the Julia-
  type is a Parabolic case, or has Siegel Disks, or has Herman Rings.

  However, all the difficult cases have one thing in common - they all
  have a parameter value that falls exactly on the edge of the related
  Mandel-type's lake.  You can avoid them by intelligent use of the
  Mandel-Julia Space-Bar toggle:  Pick a view of the related Mandel-type
  where the center of the screen is inside the lake, but not too close to
  its edge, then use the space-bar toggle.  You should obtain a usable
  Julia-type with a lake, if you follow this guideline.

  Thirdly, the initial implementation only works for Julia-types that use
  the "Standard" fractal engine in Fractint.  Fractals with their own
  special algorithms are not affected by Finite Attractor logic, as yet.

  Finally, the finite attractor code will not work if it fails to detect a
  finite attractor.  If the number of iterations is set too low, the
  finite attractor may be missed.

  Despite these restrictions, the Finite Attractor logic can produce
  interesting results.  Just bear in mind that it is principally a bonus
  off-shoot from the development of the MAGNETic fractal types, and is not
  specifically tuned for optimal performance for other Julia types.

  (Thanks to Kevin Allen for the above).

  There is a second type of finite attractor coloring, which is selected
  by setting "Look for Finite Attractor" to a negative value.  This colors
  points by the phase of the convergence to the finite attractor, instead
  of by the speed of convergence.

  For example, consider the Julia set for -0.1 + 0.7i, which is the three-
  lobed "rabbit" set.  The Finite Attractor is an orbit of length three;
  call these values a, b, and c.  Then, the Julia set iteration can
  converge to one of three sequences: a,b,c,a,b,c,..., or b,c,a,b,c,...,
  or c,a,b,c,a,b,...  The Finite Attractor phase option colors the
  interior of the Julia set with three colors, depending on which of the
  three sequences the orbit converges to.  Internally, the code determines
  one point of the orbit, say "a", and the length of the orbit cycle, say
  3.  It then iterates until the sequence converges to a, and then uses
  the iteration number modulo 3 to determine the color.
