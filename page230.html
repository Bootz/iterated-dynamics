    New L-Systems from Herb Savage
    New IFS types from Alex Matulich
    Many new formulas in fractint.frm, including a large group from JM
      Collard-Richard
    Generalized type manzpwr with complex exponent per Lee Skinner's
    request
    Initial orbit parameter added to Gingerbreadman fractal type

    New color maps (neon, royal, volcano, blues, headache) from Daniel
    Egnor

    IFS type has changed to use a single file containing named entries
      (instead of a separate xxx.ifs file per type); the &lt;z&gt; command
      brings up IFS editor (used to be &lt;i&gt; command).  See Barnsley IFS
      Fractals (p. 53).

    Much improved support for PaintJet printers; see PaintJet Parameters
    (p. 145)

    From Scott Taylor:
      Support for plotters using HP-GL; see Plotter Parameters (p. 146)
      Lots of new PostScript halftones; see PostScript Parameters (p. 143)
      "printer=PS[L]/0/..." for full page PostScript; see PostScript
      Parameters (p. 143)
      Option to drive printer ports directly (faster); see Printer
      Parameters (p. 142)
      Option to change printer end of line control chars; see Printer
      Parameters (p. 142)

    Support for XGA video adapter
    Support for Targa+ video adapter
    16 color VGA mode enhancements:
      Now use the first 16 colors of .map files to be more predictable
      Palette editor now works with these modes
      Color cycling now works properly with these modes Targa video
    adapter fixes; Fractint now uses (and requires) the "targa"
      and "targaset" environment variables for Targa systems
    "vesadetect=no" parameter to bypass use of VESA video driver; try
      this if you encounter video problems with a VESA driver Upgraded
    video adapter detect and handling from John Bridges; autodetect
      added for NCR, Trident 8900, Tseng 4000, Genoa (this code is from a
      beta release of VGAKIT, we're not sure it all works yet)

    Zoom box is included in saved/printed images (but, is not recognized
      as anything special when such an image is restored)

    The colors numbers reserved by the palette editor are now selectable
      with the new &lt;v&gt; palette editing mode command

    Option to use IIT floating point chip's special matrix arithmetic for
      faster 3D transforms; see "fpu=" in Startup Parameters (p. 122)

    Disk video cache increased to 64k; disk video does less seeking when
      running to real disk
    Faster floating point code for 287 and higher fpus, for types mandel,
      julia, barnsleyj1/m1/j2/m2, lambda, manowar, from Chuck Ebbert
