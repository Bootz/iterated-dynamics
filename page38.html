  The browser can now use expanded memory or extended memory.  If you have
  more than 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available, you can use
  either.  If you don't have 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available,
  use expanded memory as it will allocate as much as possible.  The
  extended memory support will silently fail and default to the use of far
  memory if 4 MB of extended memory is not available.

  Here's a tip on how to zoom out beyond your starting point when
  browsing: Suppose you restore a fractal deeply-zoomed down in a
  directory of related zoomed images, and then bring up the browser.  How
  do you zoom out? You can't use "\" because you started with the zoomed
  image, and there is no browser command to detect the next outer image.
  What you can do is exit the browser, press PgUp until the zoom box won't
  get any smaller, zoom out with Ctrl-Enter, and before any image starts
  to develop, call up the browser again, locate your zoomed image that you
  started with, and see if there is another image that contains it - if
  so, restore it with the browser.  You can also use a view window &lt;v&gt; to
  load the first image, and then use the browser.

  POSSIBLE ERRORS:

  "Sorry..I can't find anything"
  The browser can't locate any files which match the file name mask.  See
  Browser Parameters (p. 149)  This is also displayed if you have less
  than 10K of far memory free when you run Fractint.

  "Sorry....  no more space"
  At the moment the browser can only cope with 450 sub images at one time.
  Any subsequent images are ignored.  Make sure that the minimum image
  size isn't set too small on the parameters screen.

  "Sorry .... out of memory"
  The browser has run out of far, expanded, or extended memory in which to
  store the pixels covered by the sub image boxes.  Try again with the
  main image at lower resolution, and/or reduce the number of TSRs
  resident in memory when you start Fractint.  Make sure you have expanded
  or extended memory available.

  "Sorry...it's a read only file, can't del &lt;filename&gt;"
  "Sorry....can't rename"
  The file which you were trying to delete or rename has the read only
  attribute set, you'll need to reset this with your operating system
  before you can get rid of it.
