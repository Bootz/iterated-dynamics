        color = c modulo(number of colors)

  cmplxmarksjul (p. 56)
      A generalization of the marksjulia fractal.
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = c^(exp-1)*z(n)^2 + c.
      Four parameters: real and imaginary parts of c,
      and real and imaginary parts of exponent.

  cmplxmarksmand (p. 56)
      A generalization of the marksmandel fractal.
        z(0) = c = pixel;
        z(n+1) = c^(exp-1)*z(n)^2 + c.
      Four parameters: real and imaginary parts of perturbation
      of z(0), and real and imaginary parts of exponent.

  complexnewton, complexbasin (p. 48)
      Newton fractal types extended to complex degrees. Complexnewton
      colors pixels according to the number of iterations required to
      escape to a root. Complexbasin colors pixels according to which
      root captures the orbit. The equation is based on the newton
      formula for solving the equation z^p = r
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = ((p - 1) * z(n)^p + r)/(p * z(n)^(p - 1)).
      Four parameters: real &amp; imaginary parts of degree p and root r.

  diffusion (p. 69)
      Diffusion Limited Aggregation.  Randomly moving points
      accumulate.  Three parameters: border width (default 10), type,
      and color change rate.

  dynamic (p. 75)
      Time-discrete dynamic system.
        x(0) = y(0) = start position.
        y(n+1) = y(n) + f( x(n) )
        x(n+1) = x(n) - f( y(n) )
        f(k) = sin(k + a*fn1(b*k))
      For implicit Euler approximation: x(n+1) = x(n) - f( y(n+1) )
      Five parameters: start position step, dt, a, b, and the function fn1.

  escher_julia (p. 83)
      Escher-like tiling of Julia sets from The Science of Fractal Images
        z(0) = pixel
        z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + (0, 0i)
      The target set is a second, scaled, Julia set:
        T = [ z: | (z * 15.0)^2 + c | &lt; BAILOUT ]
      Two parameters: real and imaginary parts of c
      Iteration count and bailout size apply to both Julia sets.

  fn(z)+fn(pix) (p. 57)
        c = z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = fn1(z) + p*fn2(c)
      Six parameters: real and imaginary parts of the perturbation
      of z(0) and factor p, and the functions fn1, and fn2.
