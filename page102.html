   Set the screen resolution to the highest you can view and press 'Ctrl-
   e' to bring up the control panel and enable evolving mode. Set the
   gridsize to 29 and leave the parameters at their defaults. Now, press
   'F6' to enter 'variable tweak central' and set trig function 1 to 'x'
   and trig function 2 to 'y', and all the others to 'no'. Exit the two
   screens and you'll see generated all of the different combinations
   possible even if they are rather small examples!

   To find out what particular combination of trig functions an image is
   using, just select the image using the zoombox and bring up the 'z'
   screen. You don't have to press 'Enter', simply highlighting the
   appropriate image with the ctrl-arrow keys will do.

   And that just about sums up the evolver! Much more could be written but
   it's better experienced, try writing your formulae with more variable
   parameters and trig functions so that their behavior can be
   investigated.

   Try using it with any fractal type, if in doubt just see what happens!

   It should be noted here that some of the fractal types such as the IFS
   do not terminate, they run on forever and as such aren't usable with
   the evolver as the first sub image would never finish to allow the next
   one to generate.  These fractal types are detected and you won't be
   allowed to start the evolver with these.

   There now only remains to mention that you can save image sets and
   restore them later to carry on exploring from a different seed image:
   's' saves and 'r' restores as in normal fractint operation and the
   screenfull is saved as a single gif file.

   Have fun!  See Evolver Commands (p. 38).


 3.13 Random Dot Stereograms (RDS)

  Random Dot Stereograms (RDS) are a way of encoding stereo images on a
  flat screen. Fractint can convert any image to a RDS using either the
  color number in the current palette or the grayscale value as depth. Try
  these steps. Generate a plasma fractal using the 640x480x256 video mode.
  When the image on the screen is complete, press &lt;ctrl-s&gt; ("s" for
  "Stereo"), and press &lt;Enter&gt; at the "RDS Parameters" screen prompt to
  accept the defaults. (More on the parameters in a moment.) The screen
  will be converted into a seemingly random collection of colored dots.
  Relax your eyes, looking through the screen rather than at the screen
  surface. The image will (hopefully) resolve itself into the hills and
  valleys of the 3D Plasma fractal.

  Because pressing the two-keyed &lt;ctrl-s&gt; gets tiresome after a while, we
  have made &lt;k&gt; key a synonym for &lt;ctrl-s&gt; for convenience.  Don't get too
  attached to &lt;k&gt; though; we reserve the right to reuse it for another
  purpose later.

  The RDS feature has five and sometimes six parameters. Pressing &lt;ctrl-s&gt;
  always takes you to the parameter screen.
