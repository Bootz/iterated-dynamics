  You can leave any of the four comment fields unchanged by leaving that
  position blank. For example, the command comment=//Created_$date$
  inserts the text "Created Aug 17, 1996" into the third comment.

  BATCH=yes
  See Batch Mode (p. 148).

  AUTOKEY=play|record
  Specifying "play" runs Fractint in playback mode - keystrokes are read
  from the autokey file (see next parameter) and interpreted as if they're
  being entered from the keyboard.

  Specifying "record" runs in recording mode - all keystrokes are recorded
  in the autokey file.

  See also Autokey Mode (p. 89).

  AUTOKEYNAME=[filename]
  Specifies the file name to be used in autokey mode. The default file
  name is AUTO.KEY.

  MAKEDOC[=filename]
  Create Fractint documentation file (for printing or viewing with a text
  editor) and then return to DOS.  Filename defaults to FRACTINT.DOC.
  There's also a function in Fractint's online help which can be used to
  produce the documentation file - use "Printing Fractint Documentation"
  from the main help index.

  MAXHISTORY=&lt;nnn&gt;
  Fractint maintains a list of parameters of the past 10 images that you
  generated in the current Fractint session. You can revisit these images
  using the &lt;h&gt; and &lt;Ctrl-h&gt; commands. The maxhistory command allows you
  to set the number of image parameter sets stored in memory. The tradeoff
  is between the convenience of storing more images and memory use. Each
  image in the circular history buffer takes up over 1200 bytes, so the
  default value of ten images uses up 12,000 bytes of memory. If your
  memory is very tight, and some memory-intensive Fractint operations are
  giving "out of memory" messages, you can reduce maxistory to 2 or even
  zero. Keep in mind that every time you color cycle or change from
  integer to float or back, another image parameter set is saved, so the
  default ten images are used up quickly.

  FPU=387
  This parameter is useful if you have an unusual coprocessor chip. If you
  have a 80287 replacement chip with full 80387 functionality use
  "FPU=387" to inform Fractint to take advantage of those extra 387
