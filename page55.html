  If you think of the interior triangles as "holes", they occupy more and
  more of the total area, while the "solid" portion becomes as hopelessly
  fragile as that gasket you HAD to remove without damaging it -- you
  remember, that Sunday afternoon when all the parts stores were closed?
  There's a three-dimensional equivalent using nested tetrahedrons instead
  of triangles, but it generates too much pyramid power to be safely
  unleashed yet.

  There are no parameters for this type. We were able to implement it with
  integer math routines, so it runs fairly quickly even without an FPU.


 2.17 Quartic Mandelbrot/Julia

  (type=mandel4/julia4)

  These fractal types are the moral equivalent of the original M and J
  sets, except that they use the formula Z(n+1) = Z(n)^4 + C, which adds
  additional pseudo-symmetries to the plots. The "Mandel4" set maps to the
  "Julia4" set via -- surprise! -- the spacebar toggle. The M4 set is kind
  of boring at first (the area between the "inside" and the "outside" of
  the set is pretty thin, and it tends to take a few zooms to get to any
  interesting sections), but it looks nice once you get there. The Julia
  sets look nice right from the start.

  Other powers, like Z(n)^3 or Z(n)^7, work in exactly the same fashion.
  We used this one only because we're lazy, and Z(n)^4 = (Z(n)^2)^2.


 2.18 Distance Estimator

  (distest=nnn/nnn)

  This used to be type=demm and type=demj.  These types have not died, but
  are only hiding!  They are equivalent to the mandel and julia types with
  the "distest=" option selected with a predetermined value.

  The Distance Estimator Method (p. 91) can be used to produce higher
  quality images of M and J sets, especially suitable for printing in
  black and white.

  If you have some *.fra files made with the old types demm/demj, you may
  want to convert them to the new form.  See the Mandelfn (p. 52) section
  for directions to carry out the conversion.


 2.19 Pickover Mandelbrot/Julia Types

  (type=manfn+zsqrd/julfn+zsqrd, manzpowr/julzpowr, manzzpwr/julzzpwr,
  manfn+exp/julfn+exp - formerly included man/julsinzsqrd and
  man/julsinexp which have now been generalized)

  These types have been explored by Clifford A. Pickover, of the IBM
  Thomas J. Watson Research center. As implemented in Fractint, they are
  regular Mandelbrot/Julia set pairs that may be plotted with or without
  the "biomorph" (p. 95) option Pickover used to create organic-looking
