  overwritten by each auto save until the image completes.  But note that
  Fractint does not directly over-write save files.  Instead, each save
  operation writes a temporary file FRACTINT.TMP, then deletes the prior
  save file, then renames FRACTINT.TMP to be the new save file.  This
  protects against power failures which occur during a save operation - if
  such a power failure occurs, the prior save file is intact and there's a
  harmless incomplete FRACTINT.TMP on your disk.

  If you want to spread a many-hour image over multiple bits of free
  machine time you could use a command like:
      fractint batch=yes filename=xxx savename=xxx savetime=60 video=F3
  While this batch is running, hit &lt;S&gt; (almost any key actually) to tell
  fractint to save what it has done so far and give your machine back.  A
  status code of 2 is returned by fractint to the batch file.  Kick off
  the batch again when you have another time slice for it.

  When the savetime parameter is negative, Fractint will save the image
  after the requested time and exit.  This is useful in batch files where
  you want to generate several images with a time limit on each image.

  While running a batch file, pressing any key will cause Fractint to exit
  with an errorlevel = 2.  Any error that interrupts an image save to disk
  will cause an exit with errorlevel = 2.  Any error that prevents an
  image from being generated will cause an exit with errorlevel = 1.

  The SAVETIME= parameter, and batch resumes of partial calculations, only
  work with fractal types which can be resumed.  See "Interrupting and
  Resuming" (p. 33) for information about non-resumable types.


 5.20 Browser Parameters

  This Screen enables you to control Fractint's built in file browsing
  utility.  If you don't know what that is see Browse Commands (p. 37).
  This screen is selected with &lt;Ctrl-B&gt; from just about anywhere.

  "Autobrowsing"
  Select yes if you want the loaded image to be scanned for sub images
  immediately without pressing 'L' every time.

  "Ask about GIF video mode"
  Allows turning on and off the display of the video mode table when
  loading GIFs.  This has the same effect as the askvideo= command.

  "Type/Parm check"
  Select whether the browser tests for fractal type or parms when deciding
  whether a file is a sub image of the current screen or not. DISABLE WITH
  CAUTION! or things could get confusing. These tests can be switched off
  to allow such situations as wishing to display old images that were
  generated using a formula type which is now implemented as a built in
  fractal type.
  "Confirm deletes"
  Set this to No if you get fed up with the double prompting that the
  browser gives when deleting a file.  It won't get rid of the first
  prompt however.
