  LFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][lsystemfile]
  Specifies the default L-System path and/or file for type=lsystem
  fractals (default is FRACTINT.L).

  IFSFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][ifsfilename]
  Specifies the default path and/or file for type=ifs fractals (default is
  FRACTINT.IFS).

  FILENAME=[.suffix]
  Sets the default file extension used for the &lt;r&gt; command.  When this
  parameter is omitted, the default file mask shows .GIF and .POT files.
  You might want to specify this parameter and the SAVENAME= parameter in
  your SSTOOLS.INI file if you keep your fractal images separate from
  other .GIF files by using a different suffix for them.

  ORBITSAVE=yes
  Causes the file ORBITS.RAW to be opened and the points generated by
  orbit fractals or IFS fractals to be saved in a raw format. This file
  can be read by the Acrospin program which can rotate and scale the image
  rapidly in response to cursor-key commands. The filename ORBITS.RAW is
  fixed and will be overwritten each time a new fractal is generated with
  this option.
  (see Barnsley IFS Fractals (p. 53) Orbit Fractals (p. 60) Acrospin
  (p. 203)).


 5.12 Video Parameters

  VIDEO=xxx
  Set the initial video mode (and bypass the informational screens). Handy
  for batch runs. (Example: VIDEO=F4 for IBM 16-color VGA.)  You can
  obtain the current VIDEO= values (key assignments) from the "select
  video mode" screens inside Fractint. If you want to do a batch run with
  a video mode which isn't currently assigned to a key, you'll have to
  modify the key assignments - see "Video Mode Function Keys" (p. 36).

  ASKVIDEO=yes|no
  If "no," this eliminates the prompt asking you if a file to be restored
  is OK for your current video hardware.
  WARNING: every version of Fractint so far has had a bigger, better, but
  shuffled-around video table. Since calling for a mode your hardware
  doesn't support can leave your system in limbo, be careful about leaving
  the above two parameters in a command file to be used with future
  versions of Fractint, particularly for the super-VGA modes.


  ADAPTER=hgc|cga|ega|egamono|mcga|vga|ATI|Everex|Trident|NCR|Video7|Genoa|
          Paradise|Chipstech|Tseng3000|Tseng4000|AheadA|AheadB|Oaktech
  Bypasses Fractint's internal video autodetect logic and assumes that the
  specified kind of adapter is present. Use this parameter only if you
  encounter video problems without it.  Specifying adapter=vga with an
  SVGA adapter will make its extended modes unusable with Fractint.  All
  of the options after the "VGA" option specify specific SuperVGA chipsets
  which are capable of video resolutions higher than that of a "vanilla"
  VGA adapter.  Note that Fractint cares about the Chipset your adapter
  uses internally, not the name of the company that sold it to you.
