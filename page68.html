  Note that if x is an integer, floor(x) = ceil(x) = trunc(x) = round(x) =
  x.

  Remember that when using integer math there is a limited dynamic range,
  so what you think may be a fractal could really be just a limitation of
  the integer math range.  God may work with integers, but God's dynamic
  range is many orders of magnitude greater than our puny 32 bit
  mathematics!  Always verify with the floating point &lt;F&gt; toggle.
  The possible values for symmetry are:
  XAXIS,  XAXIS_NOPARM
  YAXIS,  YAXIS_NOPARM
  XYAXIS, XYAXIS_NOPARM
  ORIGIN, ORIGIN_NOPARM
  PI_SYM, PI_SYM_NOPARM
  XAXIS_NOREAL
  XAXIS_NOIMAG

  These will force the symmetry even if no symmetry is actually present,
  so try your formulas without symmetry before you use these.

 2.36 Julibrots

  (type=julibrot)

  The Julibrot fractal type uses a general-purpose renderer for
  visualizing three dimensional solid fractals. Originally Mark Peterson
  developed this rendering mechanism to view a 3-D sections of a 4-D
  structure he called a "Julibrot".  This structure, also called "layered
  Julia set" in the fractal literature, hinges on the relationship between
  the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Each Julia set is created using a fixed
  value c in the iterated formula z^2 + c. The Julibrot is created by
  layering Julia sets in the x-y plane and continuously varying c,
  creating new Julia sets as z is incremented. The solid shape thus
  created is rendered by shading the surface using a brightness inversely
  proportional to the virtual viewer's eye.

  Starting with Fractint version 18, the Julibrot engine can be used with
  other Julia formulas besides the classic z^2 + c. The first field on the
  Julibrot parameter screen lets you select which orbit formula to use.

  You can also use the Julibrot renderer to visualize 3D cross sections of
  true four dimensional Quaternion and Hypercomplex fractals.

  The Julibrot Parameter Screens

  Orbit Algorithm - select the orbit algorithm to use. The available
     possibilities include 2-D Julia and both mandelbrot and Julia
     variants of the 4-D Quaternion and Hypercomplex fractals.

  Orbit parameters - the next screen lets you fill in any parameters
     belonging to the orbit algorithm. This list of parameters is not
     necessarily the same as the list normally presented for the orbit
