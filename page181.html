  marksmandelpwr (p. 56)
      The marksmandelpwr formula type generalized (it previously
      had fn=sqr hard coded).
        z(0) = pixel, c = z(0) ^ (z(0) - 1):
        z(n+1) = c * fn(z(n)) + pixel,
      Parameters: real and imaginary perturbations of z(0), and fn

  newtbasin (p. 47)
      Based on the Newton formula for finding the roots of z^p - 1.
      Pixels are colored according to which root captures the orbit.
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = ((p-1)*z(n)^p + 1)/(p*z(n)^(p - 1)).
      Two parameters: the polynomial degree p, and a flag to turn
      on color stripes to show alternate iterations.

  newton (p. 48)
      Based on the Newton formula for finding the roots of z^p - 1.
      Pixels are colored according to the iteration when the orbit
      is captured by a root.
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = ((p-1)*z(n)^p + 1)/(p*z(n)^(p - 1)).
      One parameter: the polynomial degree p.

  phoenix (p. 80)
      z(0) = pixel, y(0) = 0;
      For degree = 0: z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + p1.x + p2.x*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      For degree &gt;= 2:
       z(n+1) = z(n)^degree + p1.x*z(n)^(degree-1) + p2.x*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      For degree &lt;= -3:
       z(n+1) = z(n)^|degree| + p1.x*z(n)^(|degree|-2)
              + p2.x*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      Three parameters: real parts of p1 &amp; p2, and degree.

  phoenixcplx (p. 80)
      z(0) = pixel, y(0) = 0;
      For degree = 0: z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + p1 + p2*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      For degree &gt;= 2:
        z(n+1) = z(n)^degree + p1*z(n)^(degree-1) + p2*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      For degree &lt;= -3:
        z(n+1) = z(n)^|degree| + p1*z(n)^(|degree|-2) + p2*y(n), y(n+1) = z(n)
      Five parameters: real &amp; imaginary parts of p1 &amp; p2, and degree.

  pickover (p. 63)
      Orbit in three dimensions defined by:
        x(n+1) = sin(a*y(n)) - z(n)*cos(b*x(n))
        y(n+1) = z(n)*sin(c*x(n)) - cos(d*y(n))
        z(n+1) = sin(x(n))
      Parameters: a, b, c, and d.

  plasma (p. 50)
      Random, cloud-like formations.  Requires 4 or more colors.
      A recursive algorithm repeatedly subdivides the screen and
      colors pixels according to an average of surrounding pixels
      and a random color, less random as the grid size decreases.
      Four parameters: 'graininess' (0, 0.125 to 100, default = 2),
      old/new algorithm, seed value used, 16-bit out output selection.
