  Tesseral ("t") is a sort of "super-solid-guessing" option that
  successively divides the image into subsections and colors in rectangles
  that have a boundary of a solid color. It's actually slower than the
  solid-guessing algorithm, but it looks neat, so we left it in. This mode
  is also subject to errors when islands of color appear inside the
  rectangles.

  Diffusion Scan ("d") is a drawing type based on dithering techniques. It
  scans the image spreading the points evenly and to each point it paints
  a square of the appropriate size so that the image will be incrementally
  enhanced. This method calculates ALL the points in the image being a
  good substitute for Single/Dual/Triple pass and presents a quick
  visualization even in the slowest fractals. With "fillcolor=0" (below)
  the squares are not painted and the points are spread over the image
  until all have being calculated (sort of a "Fade In").

  The "fillcolor=" option in the &lt;X&gt; screen or on the command line sets a
  fixed color to be used by the Boundary Tracing and Tesseral calculations
  for filling in defined regions. The effect of this is to show off the
  boundaries of the areas delimited by these two methods.

  Orbits ("o") draws an image by plotting the orbits of the escape time
  fractals.  This technique uses the same coordinates to draw an image as
  the other passes options, sets "passes=1" and no symmetry, and then
  plots the orbits for each pixel.  Zooming into a "passes=o" image is in
  fact zooming into the "passes=1" image, and the resulting image may not
  be what is expected.  To find interesting places to investigate, press
  &lt;O&gt; after an image has completed and watch the behaviour of the orbits
  as the cursor is moved around the screen.  See Orbits Window (p. 34).

  The "outside=summ" option causes Orbits to increment a pixel's color
  number every time an orbit touchs it; the resulting display is a 2-d
  histogram.  If "outside=" is some other value, then the "inside=" color
  determines the color of the plotted orbits.  If "inside=0", then the
  color number is incremented at the start of each pixel of the passes=1
  image.

  The "orbitdelay=" option controls how many orbits are computed before
  the orbits are displayed on the screen.  This allows the orbits to
  settle down.  The "orbitinterval=" option causes Orbits to plot every
  nth orbit point.  A non-zero value of the "periodicity=" option causes
  Orbits to not plot orbits that have reached the bailout conditions or
  where an orbit goes off the visible area of the image.  A zero value of
  periodicity will plot all orbits except as modified by orbitdelay and
  orbitinterval.

  Synchronous orbits ("s") is an experimental mode using the "fractal
  witchcraft" algorithm based on the Almondbread implementation by Michael
  Ganss. This algorithm optimizes deep zooms by calculating parallel
  orbits starting at different points, and subdividing when the orbits
  break formation.  Michael's implementation had to be extensively
  modified to work with Fractint's DOS medium memory model environment.

  Synchronous orbits (also known as SOI) has some limitations. SOI is
  loosely coupled with fractint and most options don't work with it. Only
  types mandel and julia are implemented. SOI is only useful for very deep
