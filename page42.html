  b) Run Xfractint from the directory containing fractint.hlp, or
  c) Copy fractint.hlp to /usr/local/bin/X11/fractint

  If you get the message "Invalid help signature", the problem is due to
  byteorder.  You are probably using a Sun help file on a Dec machine or
  vice versa.

  If Xfractint doesn't accept input, try typing into both the graphics
  window and the text window.  On some systems, only one of these works.

  If you are using Openwindows and can't get Xfractint to accept input,
  add to your .Xdefaults file:
  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:      True

  If you cannot view the GIFs that Xfractint creates, the problem is that
  Xfractint creates GIF89a format and your viewer probably only handles
  GIF87a format.  Run "xfractint gif87a=y" to produce GIF87a format.

  Because many shifted characters are used to simulate IBM keys, you can't
  enter capitalized filenames.
