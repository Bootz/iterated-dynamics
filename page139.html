  spectrum of frequencies. The Advanced Sound Controls (p. 139) screen
  also has a facility to restrict the notes played further so that you can
  produce tunes in a particular key, if you're so inclined.


 5.13.2 Advanced Sound Controls

  The soundcard output from fractint is a tad more versatile than the
  simple tones of the PC speaker. This comes into its own when playing
  sounds based on fractal orbits, producing results from haunting chordal
  pulses through to unearthly arpeggios.

  The voices used to generate notes on the sound card have variable
  Envelopes (p. 141) and can be played polyphonically so we have three
  parameters to vary the sounds produced:

  POLYPHONY=nn
  This controls how many different note are allowed to sound at once,
  voices are assigned cyclically as notes are played: i.e. after the first
  orbit is calculated a frequency is assigned to the first voice and that
  note is triggered on. Fractint then waits for one orbitdelay period,
  calculates the next orbit, assigns a frequency to the second voice, and
  triggers it on.  This continues until the number of voices sounding is
  equal to the polyphony value whereupon the first selected voice is
  triggered off and the note allowed to decay.  That probably all sounds
  horrendously complex but just think of it as playing the organ, holding
  down each new note for as long as possible but with the polyphony value
  controlling how many fingers you have.
