  If you question the relevance of these images to Escher, check out his
  Circle Limit series (especially III and IV). In his own words: "It is to
  be doubted whether there exist today many ... artists of any kind, to
  whom the desire has come to penetrate to the depths of infinity....
  There is only one possible way of ... obtaining an "infinity" entirely
  enclosed within a logical boundary line.... The largest ... shapes are
  now found in the center and the limit of infinite number and infinite
  smallness is reached at the circumference.... Not one single component
  ever reaches the edge.  For beyond that there is "absolute nothingness."
  And yet this round world cannot exist without the emptiness around it,
  not simply because "within" presupposes "without", but also because it
  is out there in the "nothingness" that the center points of the arcs
  that go to build up the framework are fixed with such geometric
  exactitude."

 2.53 Latoocarfian

  (type=latoocarfian)

  This fractal type first appeared in the book "Chaos in Wonderland" by
  Clifford Pickover (ISBN 0-312-10743-9 St. Martin's Press)

  The Latoocarfians are beings that inhabit the moon Ganymede (of Jupiter)
  and have their forms generated by these formulas.

  The initial points plotted are the more chaotic initial orbits, but as
  you wait, delicate webs will begin to form as the orbits settle into a
  more periodic pattern.  Since pixels are colored by the number of times
  they are hit, the more periodic paths will become clarified with time.

  There are 4 parameters: a, b, c, d and we recomend: a &gt; -3,  b &lt; 3,  c &gt;
  0.5, d &lt; 1.5


 2.54 Mandelbrot Mix 4

  (type=mandelbrotmix4)

  Jim Muth has been publishing a "Fractal of the Day" on the fractint
  mailing list for many years now. As often as not Jim picks the formula
  Mandelbrotmix4 as the fractal continent to explore. To honor Jim, the
  fractint authors have provided this fractal as a built-in type.

  The formula is:

  MandelbrotMix4 {; Jim Muth a=real(p1), b=imag(p1), d=real(p2),
  f=imag(p2), g=1/f, h=1/d, j=1/(f-b), z=(-a*b*g*h)^j, k=real(p3)+1,
  l=imag(p3)+100, c=fn1(pixel): z=k*((a*(z^b))+(d*(z^f)))+c, |z| &lt; l }
