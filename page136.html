        o Video mode of image being remembered. A few special modes are
        *very*
          slow compared to the rest. The slow ones are: 2 and 4 color modes
          with resolution higher than 640x480; custom modes for ATI EGA Wonder,
          Paradise EGA-480, STB, Compaq portable 386, AT&amp;T 6300, and roll your
          own video modes implemented with customized YOURVID.C code.
  If you want to tune Fractint to use different "textsafe" options for
  different video modes, see "Customized Video Modes, FRACTINT.CFG"
  (p. 157).  (E.g. you might want to use the slower textsafe=save approach
  just for a few high-resolution modes which have problems with
  textsafe=yes.)

  EXITMODE=nn
  Sets the bios-supported videomode to use upon exit to the specified
  value.  nn is in hexadecimal.  The default is 3, which resets to 80x25
  color text mode on exit. With Hercules Graphics Cards, and with
  monochrome EGA systems, the exit mode is always 7 and is unaffected by
  this parameter.

  TPLUS=yes|no
  For TARGA+ adapters. Setting this to 'no' pretends a TARGA+ is NOT
  installed.

  NONINTERLACED=yes|no
  For TARGA+ adapters. Setting this to 'yes' will configure the adapter to
  a non-interlaced mode whenever possible.  It should only be used with a
  multisynch monitor. The default is no, i.e. interlaced.

  MAXCOLORRES=8|16|24
  For TARGA+ adapters. This determines the number of bits to use for color
  resolution.  8 bit color is equivalent to VGA color resolution. The 16
  and 24 bit color resolutions are true color video modes.

  PIXELZOOM=0|1|2|3
  For TARGA+ adapters. Lowers the video mode resolution by powers of 2.
  For example, the 320x200 video resolution on the TARGA+ is actually the
  640x400 video mode with a pixel zoom of 1.  Using the 640x400 video mode
  with a zoom of 3 would lower the resolution by 8, which is 2 raised to
  the 3rd power, for a full screen resolution of 80x50 pixels.

  VIEWWINDOWS=xx[/xx[/yes|no[/nn[/nn]]]]
  Set the reduction factor, final media aspect ratio, crop starting
  coordinates (y/n), explicit x size, and explicit y size, see "View
  Window" (p. 34).

  FASTRESTORE=yes|no
  If YES, resets viewwindow to "no" prior to restoring a gif file.
  Otherwise, images saved in full view will be drawn in reduced view if
  viewwindows has been set to "yes" previously. Also, when YES, bypasses
  the warning when restoring a gif in a video mode other than the one in
  which the gif was saved. Default is NO. Feature will be useful when
  cycling through a group of gifs in autokey mode.  When combined with
  askvideo=no, allows loading images with the last successfully used video
  mode.  This is handy when viewing 1600x1200 images when you only have
  1024x768 available.
