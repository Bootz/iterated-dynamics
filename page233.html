      Both should now be auto-detected and operate correctly in text
      modes.  Options adapter=egamono and adapter=hgc added.
    Fixed color L-Systems to not use color 0 (black).
    PostScript printing fix.

  Version 14, 8/90

    LAST MINUTE NEWS FLASH!
      CompuServe announces the GIF89a on August 1, 1990, and Fractint
      supports it on August 2! GIF files can now contain fractal
      information!  Fractint now saves its files in the new GIF89a format
      by default, and uses .GIF rather than .FRA as a default filetype.
      Note that Fractint still *looks* for a .FRA file on file restores if
      it can't find a .GIF file, and can be coerced into using the old
      GIF87a format with the new 'gif87a=yes' command-line option.

    Pieter Branderhorst mounted a major campaign to get his name in
    lights:
    Mouse interface:  Diagonals, faster movement, improved feel. Mouse
      button assignments have changed - see the online help.
    Zoom box enhancements:  The zoom box can be rotated, stretched,
      skewed, and panned partially offscreen.  See "More Zoom Box
      Commands".
    FINALLY!! You asked for it and we (eventually, by talking Pieter into
      it [actually he grabbed it]) did it!  Images can be saved before
      completion, for a subsequent restore and continue.  See
      "Interrupting and Resuming" and "Batch Mode".
    Off-center symmetry:  Fractint now takes advantage of x or y axis
      symmetry anywhere on the screen to reduce drawing time.
    Panning:  If you move an image up, down, left, or right, and don't
      change anything else, only the new edges are calculated.
    Disk-video caching - it is now possible, reasonable even, to do most
      things with disk video, including solid guessing, 3d, and plasma.
    Logarithmic palette changed to use all colors.  It now matches regular
      palette except near the "lake".  "logmap=old" gets the old way.
    New "savetime=nnn" parameter to save checkpoints during long
    calculations.
    Calculation time is shown in &lt;Tab&gt; display.

    Kevin C Allen    Finite Attractor, Bifurcation Engine, Magnetic
    fractals...
    Made Bifurcation/Verhulst into a generalized Fractal Engine (like
      StandardFractal, but for Bifurcation types), and implemented
      periodicity checking for Bifurcation types to speed them up.
    Added Integer version of Verhulst Bifurcation (lots faster now).
      Integer is the default.  The Floating-Point toggle works, too.
    Added NEW Fractal types BIFLAMBDA, BIF+SINPI, and BIF=SINPI. These are
      Bifurcation types that make use of the new Engine. Floating-
      point/Integer toggle is available for BIFLAMBDA. The SINPI types are
      Floating-Point only, at this time.
    Corrected the generation of the MandelLambda Set.  Sorry, but it's
      always been wrong (up to v 12, at least).  Ask Mandelbrot !
    Added NEW Fractal types MAGNET1M, MAGNET1J, MAGNET2M, MAGNET2J from
      "The Beauty of Fractals".  Floating-Point only, so far, but what do
      you expect with THESE formulae ?!
    Added new symmetry types XAXIS NOIMAG and XAXIS NOREAL, required by
