  which are supposedly using extended or expanded memory.  This problem
  can occur because, to multi-task, sometimes Windows must page an
  application's expanded or extended memory to disk, in big chunks.
  Fractint's own cached disk access may be faster in such cases.


 6.3 Customized Video Modes, FRACTINT.CFG

  If you have a favorite adapter/video mode that you would like to add to
  Fractint... if you want some new sizes of disk-video modes... if you
  want to remove table entries that do not apply to your system... if you
  want to specify different "textsafe=" options for different video
  modes... relief is here, and without even learning "C"!

  You can do these things by modifying the FRACTINT.CFG file with your
  text editor. Saving a backup copy of FRACTINT.CFG first is of course
  highly recommended!

  Fractint uses a video adapter table for most of what it needs to know
  about any particular adapter/mode combination. The table is loaded from
  FRACTINT.CFG each time Fractint is run. It can contain information for
  up to 300 adapter/mode combinations. The table entries, and the function
  keys they are tied to, are displayed in the "select video mode" screen.

  This table makes adding support for various third-party video cards and
  their modes much easier, at least for the ones that pretend to be
  standard with extra dots and/or colors. There is even a special "roll-
  your-own" video mode (mode 19) enabling those of you with "C" compilers
  and a copy of the Fractint source to generate video modes supporting
  whatever adapter you may have.

  The table as currently distributed begins with nine standard and several
  non-standard IBM video modes that have been exercised successfully with
  a PS/2 model 80. These entries, coupled with the descriptive comments in
  the table definition and the information supplied (or that should have
  been supplied!) with your video adapter, should be all you need to add
  your own entries.

  After the IBM and quasi-pseudo-demi-IBM modes, the table contains an
  ever-increasing number of entries for other adapters. Almost all of
  these entries have been added because someone like you sent us spec
  sheets, or modified Fractint to support them and then informed us about
  it.

  Lines in FRACTINT.CFG which begin with a semi-colon are treated as
  comments.  The rest of the lines must have eleven fields separated by
  commas.  The fields are defined as:

  1. Key assignment. F2 to F10, SF1 to SF10, CF1 to CF10, or AF1 to AF10.
     Blank if no key is assigned to the mode.
  2. The name of the adapter/video mode (25 chars max, no leading blanks).
     The adapter is set up for that mode via INT 10H, with:
  3. AX = this,
  4. BX = this,
  5. CX = this, and
  6. DX = this (hey, having all these registers wasn't OUR idea!)
