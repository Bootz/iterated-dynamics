  Note: many of Fractint's options do not work with arbitrary precision.
  To experiment with arbitrary precision at the speedier ordinary
  magnifications, start Fractint with the debug=3200 command-line option.
  With the exception of mandel and manzpower perturbations, values that
  would normally be entered in the Parameters and Coordinates screens need
  to be entered using the command-line interface or .par files.  Other
  known things that do not yet work with arbitrary precision are:
  biomorph, decomp, distance estimator, inversion, Julia-Mandel switch,
  history, orbit-in-window, and the browse feature.


 8.2.4 The Fractint "Fractal Engine" Architecture

  Several of the authors would never ADMIT this, but Fractint has evolved
  a powerful and flexible architecture that makes adding new fractals very
  easy. (They would never admit this because they pride themselves on
  being the sort that mindlessly but happily hacks away at code and "sees
  if it works and doesn't hang the machine".)

  Many fractal calculations work by taking a rectangle in the complex
  plane, and, point by point, calculating a color corresponding to that
  point.  Furthermore, the color calculation is often done by iterating a
  function over and over until some bailout condition is met.  (See The
  Mandelbrot Set (p. 43) for a description of the iteration process.)

  In implementing such a scheme, there are three fractal-specific
  calculations that take place within a framework that is pretty much the
  same for them all.  Rather than copy the same code over and over, we
  created a standard fractal engine that calls three functions that may be
  bolted in temporarily to the engine.  The "bolting in" process uses the
  C language mechanism of variable function pointers.

  These three functions are:

     1) a setup function that is run once per image, to do any required
     initialization of variables,

     2) a once-per-pixel function that does whatever initialization has to
     be done to calculate a color for one pixel, and

     3) a once-per-orbit-iteration function, which is the fundamental
     fractal algorithm that is repeatedly iterated in the fractal
     calculation.

  The common framework that calls these functions can contain all sorts of
  speedups, tricks, and options that the fractal implementor need not
  worry about.  All that is necessary is to write the three functions in
  the correct way, and BINGO! - all options automatically apply. What
  makes it even easier is that usually one can re-use functions 1) and 2)
  written for other fractals, and therefore only need to write function
  3).

  Then it occurred to us that there might be more than one sort of fractal
  engine, so we even allowed THAT to be bolted in. And we created a data
  structure for each fractal that includes pointers to these four
  functions, various prompts, a default region of the complex plane, and
