   Fractint's decoder now handles Multi-Image Gifs.

   New SuperVGA/VESA Autodetect logic from the latest version of VGAKIT.
   Sure hope we didn't break anything.

   New register-compatible 8514/A code from Jonathan Osuch.  By default,
   Fractint now looks first for the presence of an 8514/A register-
   compatible adapter and then (and only if it doesn't find one) the
   presence of the 8514/A API (IE, HDILOAD is no longer necessary for
   register-compatible "8514/a" adapters).  Fractint can be forced to use
   the 8514/A API by using a new command-line option, "afi=yes".  Jonathan
   also added ATI's "8514/a-style" 800x600x256 and 1280x1024x16 modes.

   New XGA-detection logic for ISA-based XGA-2 systems.

   The palette editor now has a "freestyle" editing option.  See Palette
   Editing Commands (p. 25) for details.


   Fractint is now more "batch file" friendly.  When running Fractint from
   a batch file, pressing any key will cause Fractint to exit with an
   errorlevel = 2.  Any error that interrupts an image save to disk will
   cause an exit with errorlevel = 2.  Any error that prevents an image
   from being generated will cause an exit with errorlevel = 1.

   New Control-X, Control-Y, and Control-Z options flip a fractal image
   along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Origin, respectively.

   New area calculation mode in TAB screen from Ken Shirriff (for accuracy
   use inside=0).

   The TAB screen now indicates when the Integer Math algorithms are in
   use.

   The palette must now be explicitly changed, it will not reset to the
   default unexpectedly when doing things like switching video modes.

   The Julibrot type has been generalized.  Julibrot fractals can now be
   generated from PAR files.

   Added &lt;b&gt; command support for viewwindows.

   Added room for two additional PAR comments in the &lt;B&gt; command

   New coloring method for IFS shows which parts of fractal came from
   which transform.

   Added attractor basin phase plotting for Julia sets from Ken Shirriff.

   Improved finite attractor code to find more attractors from Ken
   Shirriff.

   New zero function, to be used in PAR files to replace old integer tan,
   tanh
