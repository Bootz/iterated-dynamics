  A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHORS

  Fractint is the result of a synergy between the main authors, many
  contributors, and published sources.  All of the main authors have had a
  hand in many aspects of the code.  However, each author has certain
  areas of greater contribution and creativity.  Since there is not room
  in the credits screen for the contributions of the main authors, we list
  these here to facilitate those who would like to communicate with us on
  particular subjects.

  Main Authors of Version 19 and later.

  BERT TYLER is the original author of Fractint.  He wrote the "blindingly
  fast" 386-specific 32 bit integer math code and the original video mode
  logic. Bert made Stone Soup possible, and provides a sense of direction
  when we need it. His forte is writing fast 80x86 assembler, his
  knowledge of a variety of video hardware, and his skill at hacking up
  the code we send him!

  Bert has a BA in mathematics from Cornell University.  He has been in
  programming since he got a job at the computer center in his sophomore
  year at college - in other words, he hasn't done an honest day's work in
  his life.  He has been known to pass himself off as a PC expert, a UNIX
  expert, a statistician, and even a financial modeling expert.  He is
  currently masquerading as an independent PC consultant, supporting the
  PC-to-Mainframe communications environment at NIH.  If you sent mail
  from the Internet to an NIH staffer on his 3+Mail system, it was
  probably Bert's code that mangled it during the Internet-to-3+Mail
  conversion.  He also claims to support the MS-Kermit environment at NIH.
  Fractint is Bert's first effort at building a graphics program.

  TIM WEGNER contributed the original implementation of palette animation,
  and is responsible for most of the 3D mechanisms.  He provided the main
  outlines of the "StandardFractal" engine and data structures, and is
  accused by his cohorts of being "obsessed with options". One of Tim's
  main interests is the use of four dimensional algebras to produce
  fractals.  Tim served as team coordinator for version 19, and integrated
  Wes Loewer's arbitrary precision library into Fractint.

  Tim has BA and MA degrees in mathematics from Carleton College and the
  University of California Berkeley.  He worked for 7 years overseas as a
  volunteer, doing things like working with Egyptian villagers building
  water systems. Since returning to the US in 1982, he has written shuttle
  navigation software, a software support environment prototype, and
  supported strategic information planning, all at NASA's Johnson Space
  Center. After a two-year stint at full-time writing, he's back at NASA
  developing shuttle navigation software.

  JONATHAN OSUCH started throwing pebbles into the soup around version
  15.0 with a method for simulating an if-then-else structure using the
  formula parser.  He has contributed the fn||fn fractal types, the built-
