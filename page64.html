  Michael Peters has based the HOP program on variations of these Martin
  types.  You will find three of these here: chip, quadruptwo, and
  threeply.


 2.33 Icon

  (type=icon/icon3d)

    This fractal type was inspired by the book "Symmetry in Chaos" by
    Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky (ISBN 0-19-853689-5, Oxford Press)

    To quote from the book's jacket,

      "Field and Golubitsky describe how a chaotic process eventually can
      lead to symmetric patterns (in a river, for instance, photographs of
      the turbulent movement of eddies, taken over time, often reveal
      patterns on the average."

    The Icon type implemented here maps the classic population logistic
    map of bifurcation fractals onto the complex plane in Dn symmetry.

    The initial points plotted are the more chaotic initial orbits, but as
    you wait, delicate webs will begin to form as the orbits settle into a
    more periodic pattern.  Since pixels are colored by the number of
    times they are hit, the more periodic paths will become clarified with
    time.  These fractals run continuously.

  There are 6 parameters:  Lambda, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Omega, and Degree
      Omega  0 = Dn, or dihedral (rotation + reflectional) symmetry
            !0 = Zn, or cyclic (rotational) symmetry
      Degree = n, or Degree of symmetry


 2.34 Test

  (type=test)

  This is a stub that we (and you!) use for trying out new fractal types.
  "Type=test" fractals make use of Fractint's structure and features for
  whatever code is in the routine 'testpt()' (located in the small source
  file TESTPT.C) to determine the color of a particular pixel.

  If you have a favorite fractal type that you believe would fit nicely
  into Fractint, just rewrite the C function in TESTPT.C (or use the
  prototype function there, which is a simple M-set implementation) with
  an algorithm that computes a color based on a point in the complex
  plane.

  After you get it working, send your code to one of the authors and we
  might just add it to the next release of Fractint, with full credit to
  you. Our criteria are: 1) an interesting image and 2) a formula
  significantly different from types already supported. (Bribery may also
  work. THIS author is completely honest, but I don't trust those other
  guys.) Be sure to include an explanation of your algorithm and the
  parameters supported, preferably formatted as you see here to simplify
