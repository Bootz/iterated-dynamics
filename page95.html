 3.8 Biomorphs

  Related to Decomposition (p. 93) are the "biomorphs" invented by
  Clifford Pickover, and discussed by A. K. Dewdney in the July 1989
  "Scientific American", page 110.  These are so-named because this
  coloring scheme makes many fractals look like one-celled animals.  The
  idea is simple.  The escape-time algorithm terminates an iterating
  formula when the size of the orbit value exceeds a predetermined bailout
  value. Normally the pixel corresponding to that orbit is colored
  according to the iteration when bailout happened. To create biomorphs,
  this is modified so that if EITHER the real OR the imaginary component
  is LESS than the bailout, then the pixel is set to the "biomorph" color.
  The effect is a bit better with higher bailout values: the bailout is
  automatically set to 100 when this option is in effect. You can try
  other values with the "bailout=" option.

  The biomorph option is turned on via the "biomorph=nnn" command-line
  option (where "nnn" is the color to use on the affected pixels).  When
  toggling to Julia sets, the default corners are three times bigger than
  normal to allow seeing the biomorph appendages. Does not work with all
  types - in particular it fails with any of the mandelsine family.
  However, if you are stuck with monochrome graphics, try it - works great
  in two-color modes. Try it with the marksmandel and marksjulia types.


 3.9 Continuous Potential

  Note: This option can only be used with 256 color modes.

  Fractint's images are usually calculated by the "level set" method,
  producing bands of color corresponding to regions where the calculation
  gives the same value. When "3D" transformed (see "3D" Images (p. 106)),
  most images other than plasma clouds are like terraced landscapes: most
  of the surface is either horizontal or vertical.

  To get the best results with the "illuminated" 3D fill options 5 and 6,
  there is an alternative approach that yields continuous changes in
  colors.

  Continuous potential is approximated by calculating

           potential =  log(modulus)/2^iterations

  where "modulus" is the orbit value (magnitude of the complex number)
  when the modulus bailout was exceeded, at the "iterations" iteration.
  Clear as mud, right?

  Fortunately, you don't have to understand all the details. However,
  there ARE a few points to understand. First, Fractint's criterion for
  halting a fractal calculation, the "modulus bailout value", is generally
  set to 4.  Continuous potential is inaccurate at such a low value.

  The bad news is that the integer math which makes the "mandel" and
  "julia" types so fast imposes a hard-wired maximum value of 127. You can
  still make interesting images from those types, though, so don't avoid
  them. You will see "ridges" in the "hillsides." Some folks like the
