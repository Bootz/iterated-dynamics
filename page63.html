  The default parameters are a=1.4 and b=.3.


 2.30 Pickover Attractors

  (type=pickover)

  Clifford A. Pickover of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research center is such
  a creative source for fractals that we attach his name to this one only
  with great trepidation.  Probably tomorrow he'll come up with another
  one and we'll be back to square one trying to figure out a name!

  This one is the three dimensional orbit defined by:

               xnew = sin(a*y) - z*cos(b*x)
               ynew = z*sin(c*x) - cos(d*y)
               znew = sin(x)

  Default parameters are: a = 2.24, b = .43, c = -.65, d = -2.43


 2.31 Gingerbreadman

  (type=gingerbreadman)

  This simple fractal is a charming example stolen from "Science of
  Fractal Images", p. 149.

               xnew = 1 - y + |x|
               ynew = x

  The initial x and y values are set by parameters, defaults x=-.1, y = 0.


 2.32 Martin Attractors

  (type=hopalong/martin)

  These fractal types are from A. K. Dewdney's "Computer Recreations"
  column in "Scientific American". They are attributed to Barry Martin of
  Aston University in Birmingham, England.

  Hopalong is an "orbit" type fractal like lorenz. The image is obtained
  by iterating this formula after setting z(0) = y(0) = 0:
        x(n+1) = y(n) - sign(x(n))*sqrt(abs(b*x(n)-c))
        y(n+1) = a - x(n)
  Parameters are a, b, and c. The function "sign()"  returns 1 if the
  argument is positive, -1 if argument is negative.

  This fractal continues to develop in surprising ways after many
  iterations.

  Another Martin fractal is simpler. The iterated formula is:
        x(n+1) = y(n) - sin(x(n))
        y(n+1) = a - x(n)
  The parameter is "a". Try values near the number pi.
