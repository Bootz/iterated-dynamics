        Versions  1 through 11 (p. 235)

  Version 20 (9/99) New features include:

  The new Fractal Evolver by Robin Bussell. This feature randomly perturbs
    fractal parameters in a user-controlled way, letting you see a screen
    full of postage-stamp variations of a fractal. See Parameter
    explorer/evolver (p. 98)

  New sound routines from Robin Bussell.  Now &lt;ctrl-f&gt; brings up a menu
    for changing the sounds made by Fractint.  The sound= prompt can now
    look like this: sound=off|beep|x|y|z/pc|fm/quant. See Sound Parameters
    (p. 137)

  New 32767 x 32767 (32K) pixel limit. Removed the 2048 pixel limit for
    the size of fractals. You can now define disk video modes larger than
    2048 x 2048.

  Added the experimental synchronous orbits (a.k.a. SOI) "fractal
    witchcraft" algorithm invoked using passes=s. This algorithm optimizes
    the computation of very deeply zoomed fractals by calculating parallel
    orbits, and subdividing when the orbits break formation. See Drawing
    Method (p. 86)

  Other new features and changes include:

  When resuming in pass=1, the calculation is now restarted at the last X
    value, instead of at the beginning of the row.

  Fixed browser so browsing images won't make the current image non-
  resumable.

  During an image save to disk, the 's' key is now ignored.

  Added Humberto Baptista's Epsilon Cross variation. It is triggered with
    a negative proximity. With a positive proximity value, the result
    should be backwards compatable. This assumes no one has made images
    with a negative proximity.
