  precision as you want.

  Incorporation of this feature in Fractint was inspired by Jay Hill and
  his DEEPZOOM program which uses the shareware MFLOAT programming
  library.  Several of the Stone Soup programmers noticed Jay's posts in
  the Internet sci.fractals newsgroup and began to investigate adding
  arbitrary precision to Fractint. High school math and physics teacher
  Wes Loewer wrote an arbitrary precision library in both 80x86 assembler
  and C, and the Stone Soup team incorporated Wes's library into Fractint.
  Initially, support was added for fractal types mandel, julia, manzpower,
  and julzpower.

  Normally, when you reach Fractint's zoom limit, Fractint simply refuses
  to let you zoom any more. When using the fractal types that support
  arbitrary precision, you will not reach this limit, but can keep on
  zooming. When you pass the threshold between double precision and
  arbitrary precision, Fractint will dramatically slow down. The &lt;tab&gt;
  status screen can be used to verify that Fractint is indeed using
  arbitrary precision.

  Fractals with arbitrary precision are SLOW, as much as ten times slower
  than if the math were done with your math coprocessor, and even slower
  simply because the zoom depth is greater. The good news, if you want to
  call it that, is that your math coprocessor is not needed;
  coprocessorless machines can produce deep zooms with the same glacial
  slowness as machines with coprocessors!

  Maybe the real point of arbitrary precision math is to prolong the
  "olden" days when men were men, women were women, and real fractal
  programmers spent weeks generating fractals. One of your Stone Soup
  authors has a large monitor that blinks a bit when changing video modes-
  -PCs have gotten so fast that Fractint finishes the default 320x200
  Mandelbrot before the monitor can even complete its blinking transition
  to graphics mode! Computers are getting faster every day, and soon a new
  generation of fractal lovers might forget that fractal generation is
  *supposed* to be slow, just as it was in Grandpa's day when they only
  had Pentium chips. The solution to this educational dilemma is
  Fractint's arbitrary precision feature. Even the newest sexium and
  septium machines are going to have to chug for days or weeks at the
  extreme zoom depths now possible ...

  So how far can you zoom? How does 10^1600 sound--roughly 1600 decimal
  digits of precision. To put *this* magnification in perspective, the
  "tiny" ratio of 10^61 is the ratio of the entire visible universe to the
  smallest quantum effects. With 1600 digits to work with, you can expand
  an electron-sized image up to the size of the visible universe, not once
  but more than twenty times. So you can examine screen-sized portions of
  a Mandelbrot set so large all but a tiny part of it would be vastly
  farther away than the billion or so light year limit of our best
  telescopes.

  Lest anyone suppose that we Stone Soupers suffer from an inflated pride
  over having thus spanned the Universe, current inflationary cosmological
  theories estimate the size of the universe to be unimaginably larger
  than the "tiny" part we can see.
