   Debugflag=10000 now reports video chipset in use as well as CPU/FPU
   type and available memory

   Added 6 additional parameters for params= for those fractal types that
   need them.

   New 'matherr()' logic lets Fractint get more aggressive when these
   errors happen.

   New autologmap option (log=+-2) from Robin Bussell that ensures that
   all palette values are used by searching the screen border for the
   lowest value and then setting log= to +- that color.

   Two new diffusion options - falling and square cavity.

   Three new Editpal commands: '!', '@' and '#' commands (that's &lt;shift-
   1&gt;, &lt;shift-2&gt;, and &lt;shift-3&gt;) to swap R&lt;-&gt;G, G&lt;-&gt;B, R&lt;-&gt;B.

   Parameter files now use a slightly shorter maximum line length, making
   them a bit more readable when stuffed into messages on CompuServe.

   Plasma now has 16-bit .POT output for use with Ray tracers. The "old"
   algorithm has been modified so that the plasma effect is independent of
   resolution.

   Slight modification to the Raytrace code to make it compatible with
   Rayshade 4.0 patch level 6.

   Improved boundary-tracing logic from Wesley Loewer.

   Command-line parameters can now be entered on-the-fly using the &lt;g&gt; key
   thanks to Ken Shirriff.

   Dithered gif images can now be loaded onto a b/w display.  Thanks to
   Ken Shirriff.

   Pictures can now be output as compressed PostScript.  Thanks to Ken
   Shirriff.

   Periodicity is a new inside coloring option.  Thanks to Ken Shirriff.

   Fixes: symmetry values for the SQR functions, bailout for the floating-
   pt versions of 'lambdafn' and 'mandelfn' fractals from Jonathan Osuch.

   "Flip", "conj" operators are now selectable in the parser

   New DXF Raytracing option from Dennis Bragg.

   Improved boundary-tracing logic from Wesley Loewer.

   New MSC7-style overlay structure is used if MAKEFRAC.BAT specifies
   MSC7.  (with new FRACTINT.DEF and FRACTINT.LNK files for MSC7 users).
   Several modules have been re-organized to take advantage of this new
   overlay capability if compiled under MSC7.
