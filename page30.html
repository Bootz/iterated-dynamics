  whose name ends with the matching suffix (XYZ).

  You can use &lt;F6&gt; to switch directories to the default fractint directory
  or to your own directory which is specified through the DOS environment
  variable "FRACTDIR".

  Once you have selected a file to restore, a summary description of the
  file is shown, with a video mode selection list. Usually you can just
  press &lt;Enter&gt; to go past this screen and load the image. Other choices
  available at this point are:
    Cursor keys: select a different video mode
    &lt;Tab&gt;: display more information about the fractal
    &lt;F1&gt;: for help about the "err" column in displayed video modes
  If you restore a file into a video mode which does not have the same
  pixel dimensions as the file, Fractint will make some adjustments:  The
  view window parameters (see &lt;V&gt; command) will automatically be set to an
  appropriate size, and if the image is larger than the screen dimensions,
  it will be reduced by using only every Nth pixel during the restore.


 1.7 Print Command

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;P&gt;

  Print the current fractal image on your (Laserjet, Paintjet, Epson-
  compatible, PostScript, or HP-GL) printer.

  See "Setting Defaults (SSTOOLS.INI File)" (p. 120) and "Printer
  Parameters" (p. 142) for how to let Fractint know about your printer
  setup.

  "Disk-Video" Modes (p. 156) can be used to generate images for printing
  at higher resolutions than your screen supports.


 1.8 Parameter Save/Restore Commands

  Parameter files can be used to save/restore all options and settings
  required to recreate particular images.  The parameters required to
  describe an image require very little disk space, especially compared
  with saving the image itself.

  &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;

  The &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt; command loads a set of parameters describing an image.
  (Actually, it can also be used to set non-image parameters such as
  SOUND, but at this point we're interested in images. Other uses of
  parameter files are discussed in "Parameter Files and the &lt;@&gt; Command"
  (p. 121).)

  When you hit &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;, Fractint displays the names of the entries in
  the currently selected parameter file.  The default parameter file,
  FRACTINT.PAR, is included with the Fractint release and contains
  parameters for some sample images.
