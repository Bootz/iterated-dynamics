    Increased the usable bailout values when using arbitrary precision
    math.  This is the best I can do with my minimal understanding of the
    ap-math routines.  If you are seeing extraneous pixels on your ap-math
    images when you use a high bailout, lower the bailout until they go
    away.

    Made a change to the tab display routine to correct a problem with
    displaying parameters when returning from the F6 and control-tab
    screens.

  Patch 2
  Backed out the changes to the savegraphics() and restoregraphics()
  routines.

  Patch 1
  Fixed the &lt;TAB&gt; display screen so the video memory doesn't get
    overwritten.  This clears up the problem with extraneous dots with
    some fractal types.  It should be possible to remove the textsafe=save
    from your sstools.ini file.

    Added Iain Stirling to the scrolling credits screen for his
    contribution of the inside=fmod and outside=fmod options.

    Reworded the error message received when more memory is requested than
    is available on your disk drive.

    The background= parameter, for 3D TGA files, is now saved to a PAR
    entry.

    Fixed the error message that appears when a parsing error occurs on
    startup.

    Cleaned up the savegraphics() and restoregraphics() routines.  This
    should make them faster.

  Version 20.1.0
  Incremented the version number to accommodate backwards compatibility
    for the inside=fmod option.

    Fixed the assignment of hotkeys to video modes so that the
    fractint.cfg file is no longer corrupted.  Made the showdot= feature
    reset with &lt;INS&gt; if it is entered using the &lt;g&gt; screen.  Added a check
    for the video size before invoking the palette editor.  Too small a
    size would crash Fractint.

    Fixed an extraseg conflict which occurred with arbitrary precision
    when the &lt;tab&gt; key was used with various screens open (x,y,b).  This
    conflict also occurred when loading an ap math image at the video
    selection screen.  Cleaned up some of the ap math initialization code.

    Fixed an obscure bug that left memory allocated when an unfinished
    image was being reloaded, but a video mode was not selected (escape
    was pressed).
