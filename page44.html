  from it, and indeed every point of that color -- is the set of all
  points C for which the magnitude of Z is less than 2 after 150
  iterations (150 is the default setting, changeable via the &lt;X&gt; options
  screen or "maxiter=" parameter).  All the surrounding "contours" of
  other colors represent points for which the magnitude of Z exceeds 2
  after 149 iterations (the contour closest to the M-set itself), 148
  iterations, (the next one out), and so on.

  We actually don't test for the magnitude of Z exceeding 2 - we test the
  magnitude of Z squared against 4 instead because it is easier.  This
  value (FOUR usually) is known as the "bailout" value for the
  calculation, because we stop iterating for the point when it is reached.
  The bailout value can be changed on the &lt;Z&gt; options screen but the
  default is usually best.  See also Bailout Test (p. 98).

  Some features of interest:

  1. Use the &lt;X&gt; options screen to increase the maximum number of
  iterations.  Notice that the boundary of the M-set becomes more and more
  convoluted (the technical terms are "wiggly," "squiggly," and "utterly
  bizarre") as the Z-magnitudes for points that were still within the set
  after 150 iterations turn out to exceed 2 after 200, 500, or 1200. In
  fact, it can be proven that the true boundary is infinitely long: detail
  without limit.

  2. Although there appear to be isolated "islands" of blue, zoom in --
  that is, plot for a smaller range of coordinates to show more detail --
  and you'll see that there are fine "causeways" of blue connecting them
  to the main set. As you zoomed, smaller islands became visible; the same
  is true for them. In fact, there are no isolated points in the M-set: it
  is "connected" in a strict mathematical sense.

  3. The upper and lower halves of the first image are symmetric (a fact
  that Fractint makes use of here and in some other fractal types to speed
  plotting). But notice that the same general features -- lobed discs,
  spirals, starbursts -- tend to repeat themselves (although never
  exactly) at smaller and smaller scales, so that it can be impossible to
  judge by eye the scale of a given image.

  4. In a sense, the contour colors are window-dressing: mathematically,
  it is the properties of the M-set itself that are interesting, and no
  information about it would be lost if all points outside the set were
  assigned the same color. If you're a serious, no-nonsense type, you may
  want to cycle the colors just once to see the kind of silliness that
  other people enjoy, and then never do it again. Go ahead. Just once,
  now. We trust you.


 2.2 Julia Sets

  (type=julia)

  These sets were named for mathematician Gaston Julia, and can be
  generated by a simple change in the iteration process described for the
  Mandelbrot Set (p. 43).  Start with a specified value of C, "C-real + i
  * C-imaginary"; use as the initial value of Z "x-coordinate + i * y-
