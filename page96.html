  effect.

  The good news is that the other fractal types, particularly the
  (generally slower) floating point algorithms, have no such limitation.
  The even better news is that there is a floating-point algorithm for the
  "mandel" and "julia" types.  To force the use of a floating-point
  algorithm, use Fractint with the "FLOAT=YES" command-line toggle.  Only
  a few fractal types like plasma clouds, the Barnsley IFS type, and
  "test" are unaffected by this toggle.

  The parameters for continuous potential are:
      potential=maxcolor[/slope[/modulus[/16bit]]]
  These parameters are present on the &lt;Y&gt; options screen.

  "Maxcolor" is the color corresponding to zero potential, which plots as
  the TOP of the mountain. Generally this should be set to one less than
  the number of colors, i.e. usually 255. Remember that the last few
  colors of the default IBM VGA palette are BLACK, so you won't see what
  you are really getting unless you change to a different palette.

  "Slope" affects how rapidly the colors change -- the slope of the
  "mountains" created in 3D. If this is too low, the palette will not
  cover all the potential values and large areas will be black. If it is
  too high, the range of colors in the picture will be much less than
  those available.  There is no easy way to predict in advance what this
  value should be.

  "Modulus" is the bailout value used to determine when an orbit has
  "escaped". Larger values give more accurate and smoother potential. A
  value of 500 gives excellent results. As noted, this value must be &lt;128
  for the integer fractal types (if you select a higher number, they will
  use 127).

  "16bit":  If you transform a continuous potential image to 3D, the
  illumination modes 5 and 6 will work fine, but the colors will look a
  bit granular. This is because even with 256 colors, the continuous
  potential is being truncated to integers. The "16bit" option can be used
  to add an extra 8 bits of goodness to each stored pixel, for a much
  smoother result when transforming to 3D.

  Fractint's visible behavior is unchanged when 16bit is enabled, except
  that solid guessing and boundary tracing are not used. But when you save
  an image generated with 16bit continuous potential:
   o The saved file is a fair bit larger.
   o Fractint names the file with a .POT extension instead of .GIF, if you
     didn't specify an extension in "savename".
   o The image can be used as input to a subsequent &lt;3&gt; command to get the
     promised smoother effect.
   o If you happen to view the saved image with a GIF viewer other than
     Fractint, you'll find that it is twice as wide as it is supposed to
     be. (Guess where the extra goodness was stored!) Though these files
     are structurally legal GIF files the double-width business made us
     think they should perhaps not be called GIF - hence the .POT filename
     extension.
