 4.8 3D Overlay Mode

  While the &lt;3&gt; command (see "3D" Images (p. 106)) creates its image on a
  blank screen, the &lt;#&gt; (or &lt;shift-3&gt; on some keyboards) command draws a
  second image over an existing displayed image. This image can be any
  restored image from a &lt;R&gt; command or the result of a just executed &lt;3&gt;
  command. So you can do a landscape, then press &lt;#&gt; and choose spherical
  projection to re-plot that image or another as a moon in the sky above
  the landscape. &lt;#&gt; can be repeated as many times as you like.

  It's worth noting that not all that many years ago, one of us watched
  Benoit Mandelbrot and fractal-graphics wizard Dick Voss creating just
  such a moon-over-landscape image at IBM's research center in Yorktown
  Heights, NY. The system was a large and impressive mainframe with
  floating-point facilities bigger than the average minicomputer, running
  LBLGRAPH -- what Mandelbrot calls "an independent-minded and often very
  ill-mannered heap of graphics programs that originated in work by Alex
  Hurwitz and Jack Wright of IBM Los Angeles."

  We'd like to salute LBLGRAPH, its successors, and their creators,
  because it was their graphic output (like "Planetrise over Labelgraph
  Hill," plate C9 in Mandelbrot's "Fractal Geometry of Nature") that
  helped turn fractal geometry from a mathematical curiosity into a
  phenomenon. We'd also like to point out that it wasn't as fast, flexible
  or pretty as Fractint on a 386/16 PC with S-VGA graphics. Now, a lot of
  the difference has to do with the incredible progress of micro-processor
  power since then, so a lot of the credit should go to Intel rather than
  to our highly tuned code. OK, twist our arms -- it IS awfully good code.


 4.9 Special Note for CGA or Hercules Users

  If you are one of those unfortunates with a CGA or Hercules 2-color
  monochrome graphics, it is now possible for you to make 3D projection
  images.

  Try the following unfortunately circuitous approach. Invoke Fractint,
  making sure you have set askvideo=yes. Use a disk-video mode to create a
  256 color fractal. You might want to edit the fractint.cfg file to make
  a disk-video mode with the same pixel dimensions as your normal video.
  Using the "3" command, enter the file name of the saved 256 color file,
  then select your 2 or 4 color mode, and answer the other 3D prompts. You
  will then see a 3D projection of the fractal. Another example of Stone
  Soup responsiveness to our fan mail!


 4.10 Making Terrains

  If you enjoy using Fractint for making landscapes, we have several new
  features for you to work with. When doing 3d transformations banding
  tends to occur because all pixels of a given height end up the same
  color. Now, colors can be randomized to make the transitions between
  different colors at different altitudes smoother. Use the new
  "RANDOMIZE= " variable to accomplish this. If your light source images
  all look like lunar landscapes since they are all monochrome and have
  very dark shadows, we now allow you to set the ambient light for
