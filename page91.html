 3.4 Distance Estimator Method

  This is Phil Wilson's implementation of an alternate method for the M
  and J sets, based on work by mathematician John Milnor and described in
  "The Science of Fractal Images", p. 198.  While it can take full
  advantage of your color palette, one of the best uses is in preparing
  monochrome images for a printer.  Using the 1600x1200x2 disk-video mode
  and an HP LaserJet, we have produced pictures of quality equivalent to
  the black and white illustrations of the M-set in "The Beauty of
  Fractals."

  The distance estimator method widens very thin "strands" which are part
  of the "inside" of the set.  Instead of hiding invisibly between pixels,
  these strands are made one pixel wide.

  Though this option is available with any escape time fractal type, the
  formula used is specific to the mandel and julia types - for most other
  types it doesn't do a great job.

  To turn on the distance estimator method with any escape time  fractal
  type, set the "Distance Estimator" value on the &lt;Y&gt; options screen (or
  use the "distest=" command line parameter).

  Setting the distance estimator option to a negative value -nnn enables
  edge-tracing mode.  The edge of the set is display as color number nnn.
  This option works best when the "inside" and "outside" color values are
  also set to some other value(s).

  In a 2 color (monochrome) mode, setting to any positive value results in
  the inside of the set being expanded to include edge points, and the
  outside points being displayed in the other color.

  In color modes, setting to value 1 causes the edge points to be
  displayed using the inside color and the outside points to be displayed
  in their usual colors.  Setting to a value greater than one causes the
  outside points to be displayed as contours, colored according to their
  distance from the inside of the set.  Use a higher value for narrower
  color bands, a lower value for wider ones.  1000 is a good value to
  start with.

  The second distance estimator parameter ("width factor") sets the
  distance from the inside of the set which is to be considered as part of
  the inside.  This value is expressed as a percentage of a pixel width,
  the default is 71.  Negative values are now allowed and give a fraction
  of a percent of the pixel width.  For example: -71 gives 1/71 % of the
  pixel width.

  You should use 1 or 2 pass mode with the distance estimator method, to
  avoid missing some of the thin strands made visible by it.  For the
  highest quality, "maxiter" should also be set to a high value, say 1000
  or so.  You'll probably also want "inside" set to zero, to get a black
  interior.
