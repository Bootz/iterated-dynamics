  fn(z*z) (p. 57)
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = fn(z(n)*z(n))
      One parameter: the function fn.

  fn*fn (p. 57)
        z(0) = pixel; z(n+1) = fn1(n)*fn2(n)
      Two parameters: the functions fn1 and fn2.

  fn*z+z (p. 57)
        z(0) = pixel; z(n+1) = p1*fn(z(n))*z(n) + p2*z(n)
      Five parameters: the real and imaginary components of
      p1 and p2, and the function fn.

  fn+fn (p. 57)
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = p1*fn1(z(n))+p2*fn2(z(n))
      Six parameters: The real and imaginary components of
      p1 and p2, and the functions fn1 and fn2.

  formula (p. 65)
      Formula interpreter - write your own formulas as text files!

  frothybasin (p. 80)
      Pixel color is determined by which attractor captures the orbit.  The
      shade of color is determined by the number of iterations required to
      capture the orbit.
        Z(0) = pixel;  Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 - C*conj(Z(n))
        where C = 1 + A*i, critical value of A = 1.028713768218725...

  gingerbread (p. 63)
      Orbit in two dimensions defined by:
        x(n+1) = 1 - y(n) + |x(n)|
        y(n+1) = x(n)
      Two parameters: initial values of x(0) and y(0).

  halley (p. 75)
        Halley map for the function: F = z(z^a - 1) = 0
        z(0) = pixel;
        z(n+1) = z(n) - R * F / [F' - (F" * F / 2 * F')]
        bailout when: abs(mod(z(n+1)) - mod(z(n)) &lt; epsilon
      Four parameters: order a, real part of R, epsilon,
         and imaginary part of R.

  henon (p. 62)
      Orbit in two dimensions defined by:
        x(n+1) = 1 + y(n) - a*x(n)*x(n)
        y(n+1) = b*x(n)
      Two parameters: a and b

  hopalong (p. 63)
      Hopalong attractor by Barry Martin - orbit in two dimensions.
        z(0) = y(0) = 0;
        x(n+1) = y(n) - sign(x(n))*sqrt(abs(b*x(n)-c))
        y(n+1) = a - x(n)
      Parameters are a, b, and c.
