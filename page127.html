  CORNERS=[xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[/x3rd/y3rd]]
  Example: corners=-0.739/-0.736/0.288/0.291
  Begin with these coordinates as the range of x and y coordinates, rather
  than the default values of (for type=mandel) -2.0/2.0/-1.5/1.5. When you
  specify four values (the usual case), this defines a rectangle: x-
  coordinates are mapped to the screen, left to right, from xmin to xmax,
  y-coordinates are mapped to the screen, bottom to top, from ymin to
  ymax.  Six parameters can be used to describe any rotated or stretched
  parallelogram:  (xmin,ymax) are the coordinates used for the top-left
  corner of the screen, (xmax,ymin) for the bottom-right corner, and
  (x3rd,y3rd) for the bottom-left.  Entering just "CORNERS=" tells
  Fractint to use this form rather than CENTER-MAG (see below) when saving
  parameters with the &lt;B&gt; command.

  CENTER-MAG=[Xctr/Yctr/Mag[/Xmagfactor/Rotation/Skew]]
  This is an alternative way to enter corners as a center point and a
  magnification that is popular with some fractal programs and
  publications.  Entering just "CENTER-MAG=" tells Fractint to use this
  form (the default mode) rather than CORNERS (see above) when saving
  parameters with the &lt;B&gt; command.  The &lt;TAB&gt; status display shows the
  "corners" in both forms.  When you specify three values (the usual
  case), this defines a rectangle:  (Xctr, Yctr) specifies the coordinates
  of the center of the image while Mag indicates the amount of
  magnification to use.  Six parameters can be used to describe any
  rotated or stretched parallelogram:  Xmagfactor tells how many times
  bigger the x-magnification is than the y-magnification, Rotation
  indicates how many degrees the image has been turned, and Skew tells how
  many degrees the image is leaning over.  Positive angles will rotate and
  skew the image counter-clockwise.

  BAILOUT=nnn
  Over-rides the default bailout criterion for escape-time fractals. Can
  also be set from the parameters screen after selecting a fractal type.
  See description of bailout in The Mandelbrot Set (p. 43).

  BAILOUTEST=mod|real|imag|or|and|manh|manr
  Specifies the Bailout Test (p. 98) used to determine when the fractal
  calculation has exceeded the bailout value.  The default is mod and not
  all fractal types can utilize the additional tests.

  RESET
  Causes Fractint to reset all calculation related parameters to their
  default values. Non-calculation parameters such as "printer=", "sound=",
  and "savename=" are not affected. RESET should be specified at the start
  of each parameter file entry (used with the &lt;@&gt; command) which defines
  an image, so that the entry need not describe every possible parameter -
  when invoked, all parameters not specifically set by the entry will have
  predictable values (the defaults).

  INITORBIT=pixel
  INITORBIT=nnn/nnn
  Allows control over the value used to begin each Mandelbrot-type orbit.
  "initorbit=pixel" is the default for most types; this command
  initializes the orbit to the complex number corresponding to the screen
  pixel. The command "initorbit=nnn/nnn" uses the entered value as the
  initializer. See the discussion of the Mandellambda Sets (p. 49) for
