  in bailout tests, the increase in both the maximum iteration count and
  bailout value, and bug fixes too numerous to count. Jonathan worked
  closely with Robin Bussell to implement Robin's browser mechanism in
  Fractint.

  Jonathan has a B.S. in Physics from the University of Dubuque and a B.S.
  in Computer Science from Mount Mercy College, both in Iowa.  He is
  currently working as a consultant in the nuclear power industry.

  WES LOEWER first got his foot in the Stone Soup door by writing fast
  floating point assembler routines for Mandelbrot, Julia, and Lyapunov
  fractals.  He also rewrote the boundary trace algorithms and added the
  frothybasin fractal.  His most significant contribution is the addition
  of the arbitrary precision library which allows Fractint to perform
  incredibly deep zooms.

  Wes has a B.S. in Physics from Wheaton College in Illinois.  He also
  holds an M.S. in Physics and an M.Ed. in Education from Texas A&amp;M
  University.  Wes teaches physics and math at McCullough High School in
  The Woodlands, Texas where his pupils inspire him to keep that sense of
  amazement that students get when they understand a physical or
  mathematical principle for the first time.  Since he uses Fractint to
  help teach certain mathematical principles, he's one of the few folks
  who actually gets to use Fractint on the job.  Besides his involvement
  with Fractint, Wes is the author of WL-Plot, an equation graphing
  program, and MatCalc, a matrix calculator program.

  GEORGE MARTIN first became known to Fractint users when he brought a
  modicum of order to the chaotic world of formula postings with his
  release of the Orgform program and formula compilation. George added
  IF..ELSE to the formula parser language for version 19.6. Among his
  other contributions are the ability to include formula, ifs, and lsystem
  entries in .par files, the scrolling of text in the &lt;z&gt; and F2 screens,
  and new autokey commands.

  George received an A.B. in Economics from Dartmouth College and a J.D
  from the University of Michigan. When not playing with Fractint, he
  practices law in a small village about 40 miles northwest of Detroit.


  ROBIN BUSSELL began contributing to fractint in rudimentary fashion with
  the autologmap routine and has been producing more and more complex
  interface enhancements as he gets better at what he refers to as 'this C
  programming lark' He is always grateful for the help the rest of the
  team have given in smoothing the rough edges of the ingredients he adds
  to the soup and regards the evolver feature as his greatest achievement
  to date.

  Robin had far too much fun at college in London to actually get any
  qualifications there and has since worked his way up from a workshop job
  fixing computers back in the final days of CPM, via some interesting
  work with Transputers ( an innovative British cpu that was designed to
  run in massively parallel configurations, and made a very good
  Mandlebrot set calculating machine when a few dozen or more were set to
  the task) , through to his current position of senior engineer for a
  third party suppport company where he spends his time travelling the
