     Option 4 places left and right images on the screen simultaneously as
     a stereo pair.  Also see Stereo 3D Viewing (p. 110).

  Ray Tracing Output:

     Fractint can create files of its 3d transformations which are
     compatible with many ray tracing programs. Currently four are
     supported directly: DKB (now obsolete), VIVID, MTV, and RAYSHADE. In
     addition a "RAW" output is supported which can be relatively easily
     transformed to be usable by many other products.  One other option is
     supported: ACROSPIN.  This is not a ray tracer, but the same Fractint
     options apply - see Acrospin (p. 203).

     Option values:
        0  disables the creation of ray tracing output
        1  DKB format (obsolete-see below)
        2  VIVID format
        3  generic format (must be massaged externally)
        4  MTV format
        5  RAYSHADE format
        6  ACROSPIN format
     Users of POV-Ray can use the DKB output and convert to POV-Ray with
     the DKB2POV utility that comes with POV-Ray. A better (faster)
     approach is to create a RAW output file and convert to POV-Ray with
     RAW2POV.  A still better approach is to use POV-Ray's height field
     feature to directly read the fractal .GIF or .POT file and do the 3D
     transformation inside POV-Ray.

     All ray tracing files consist of triangles which follow the surface
     created by Fractint during the 3d transform. Triangles which lie
     below the "water line" are not created in order to avoid causing
     unnecessary work for the poor ray tracers which are already
     overworked.  A simple plane can be substituted by the user at the
     waterline if needed.

     The size (and therefore the number) of triangles created is
     determined by the "coarse" parameter setting. While generating the
     ray tracing file, you will view the image from above and watch it
     partitioned into triangles.

     The color of each triangle is the average of the color of its
     verticies in the original image, unless BRIEF is selected.

     If BRIEF is selected, a default color is assigned at the begining of
     the file and is used for all triangles.

     Also see Interfacing with Ray Tracing Programs (p. 117).

  Brief output:

     This is a ray tracing sub-option.  When it is set to yes, Fractint
     creates a considerably smaller and somewhat faster file. In this
     mode, all triangles use the default color specified at the begining
     of the file.  This color should be edited to supply the color of your
