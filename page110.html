  Later, try the light source fill types. These two algorithms allow you
  to position the "sun" over your "landscape." Each pixel is colored
  according to the angle the surface makes with an imaginary light source.
  You will be asked to enter the three coordinates of the vector pointing
  toward the light in a following parameter screen - see Light Source
  Parameters (p. 113).

  "Light source before transformation" uses the illumination direction
  without transforming it. The light source is fixed relative to your
  computer screen.  If you generate a sequence of images with progressive
  rotation, the effect is as if you and the light source are fixed and the
  object is rotating. Therefore as the object rotates features of the
  object move in and out of the light.  This fill option was incorrect
  prior to version 16.1, and has been changed.

  "Light source after transformation" applies the same transformation to
  both the light direction and the object. Since both the light direction
  and the object are transformed, if you generate a sequence of images
  with the rotation progressively changed, the effect is as if the image
  and the light source are fixed in relation to each other and you orbit
  around the image. The illumination of features on the object is
  constant, but you see the object from different angles. This fill option
  was correct in earlier Fractint versions and has not been changed.

  For ease of discussion we will refer to the following fill types by
  these numbers:
      1 - surface grid
      2 - (default) - no fill at all - just draw the dots
      3 - wire frame - joins points with lines
      4 - surface fill - (colors interpolated)
      5 - surface fill - (interpolation turned off)
      6 - solid fill - draws lines from the "ground" up to the point
      7 - surface fill with light model - calculated before 3D transforms
      8 - surface fill with light model - calculated after 3D transforms

  Types 4, 7, and 8 interpolate colors when filling, making a very smooth
  fill if the palette is continuous. This may not be desirable if the
  palette is not continuous. Type 5 is the same as type 4 with
  interpolation turned off. You might want to use fill type 5, for
  example, to project a .GIF photograph onto a sphere. With type 4, you
  might see the filled-in points, since chances are the palette is not
  continuous; type 5 fills those same points in with the colors of
  adjacent pixels. However, for most fractal images, fill type 4 works
  better.

  This screen is not available if you have selected a ray tracing option.


 4.3 Stereo 3D Viewing

  The "Funny Glasses" (stereo 3D) parameter screen is presented only if
  you select a non-zero stereo option in the prior 3D parameters.  (See 3D
  Mode Selection (p. 106).)  We suggest you definitely use defaults at
  first on this screen.
