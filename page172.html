  barnsleym3 (p. 52)
        z(0) = c = pixel;
        if real(z(n) &gt; 0 then z(n+1) = (real(z(n))^2 - imag(z(n))^2 - 1)
           + i * (2*real(z((n)) * imag(z((n))) else
        z(n+1) = (real(z(n))^2 - imag(z(n))^2 - 1 + real(c) * real(z(n))
           + i * (2*real(z((n)) * imag(z((n)) + imag(c) * real(z(n))
      Parameters are perturbations of z(0)

  bifurcation (p. 58)
      Pictorial representation of a population growth model.
        Let P = new population, p = oldpopulation, r = growth rate
        The model is: P = p + r*fn(p)*(1-fn(p)).
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Function.

  bif+sinpi (p. 58)
      Bifurcation variation: model is: P = p + r*fn(PI*p).
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Function.

  bif=sinpi (p. 58)
      Bifurcation variation: model is: P = r*fn(PI*p).
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Function.

  biflambda (p. 58)
      Bifurcation variation: model is: P = r*fn(p)*(1-fn(p)).
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Function.

  bifstewart (p. 58)
      Bifurcation variation: model is: P = (r*fn(p)*fn(p)) - 1.
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Function.

  bifmay (p. 58)
      Bifurcation variation: model is: P = r*p / ((1+p)^beta).
      Three parameters: Filter Cycles, Seed Population, and Beta.

  cellular (p. 78)
      One-dimensional cellular automata or line automata.  The type of CA
      is given by kr, where k is the number of different states of the
      automata and r is the radius of the neighborhood.  The next generation
      is determined by the sum of the neighborhood and the specified rule.
      Four parameters: Initial String, Rule, Type, and Starting Row Number.
      For Type = 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 22, 32, 42, 23, 33, 24, 25, 26, 27
          Rule =  4,  7, 10, 13, 16,  6, 11, 16,  8, 15, 10, 12, 14, 16 digits

  chip (p. 63)
      Chip attractor from Michael Peters - orbit in two dimensions.
        z(0) = y(0) = 0;
        x(n+1) = y(n) - sign(x(n)) * cos(sqr(ln(abs(b*x(n)-c))))
                                   * arctan(sqr(ln(abs(c*x(n)-b))))
        y(n+1) = a - x(n)
      Parameters are a, b, and c.

  circle (p. 50)
      Circle pattern by John Connett
        x + iy = pixel
        z = a*(x^2 + y^2)
        c = integer part of z
