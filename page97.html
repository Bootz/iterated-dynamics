  A 16bit (.POT) file can be converted to an ordinary 8 bit GIF by
  &lt;R&gt;estoring it, changing "16bit" to "no" on the &lt;Y&gt; options screen, and
  &lt;S&gt;aving.

  You might find with 16bit continuous potential that there's a long delay
  at the start of an image, and disk activity during calculation. Fractint
  uses its disk-video cache area to store the extra 8 bits per pixel - if
  there isn't sufficient memory available, the cache will page to disk.

  The following commands can be used to recreate the image that Mark
  Peterson first prototyped for us, and named "MtMand":

          TYPE=mandel
          CORNERS=-0.19920/-0.11/1.0/1.06707
          INSIDE=255
          MAXITER=255
          POTENTIAL=255/2000/1000/16bit
          PASSES=1
          FLOAT=yes

  Note that prior to version 15.0, Fractint:
   o Produced "16 bit TGA potfiles" This format is no longer generated,
     but you can still (for a release or two) use &lt;R&gt; and &lt;3&gt; with those
     files.
   o Assumed "inside=maxit" for continuous potential. It now uses the
     current "inside=" value - to recreate prior results you must be
     explicit about this parameter.


 3.10 Starfields

  Once you have generated your favorite fractal image, you can convert it
  into a fractal starfield with the 'a' transformation (for 'astronomy'? -
  once again, all of the good letters were gone already).  Stars are
  generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis - the odds that a particular pixel
  will coalesce into a star are based (partially) on the color index of
  that pixel.

  (The following was supplied by Mark Peterson, the starfield author).

  If the screen were entirely black and the 'Star Density per Pixel' were
  set to 30 then a starfield transformation would create an evenly
  distributed starfield with an average of one star for every 30 pixels.

  If you're on a 320x200 screen then you have 64000 pixels and would end
  up with about 2100 stars.  By introducing the variable of 'Clumpiness'
  we can create more stars in areas that have higher color values.  At
  100% Clumpiness a color value of 255 will change the average of finding
  a star at that location to 50:50.  A lower clumpiness values will lower
  the amount of probability weighting.  To create a spiral galaxy draw
  your favorite spiral fractal (IFS, Julia, or Mandelbrot) and perform a
  starfield transformation.  For general starfields I'd recommend
  transforming a plasma fractal.
