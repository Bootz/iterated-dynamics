  of bifurcation were four and a bit.  These ratios vary, but, as the
  growth rate increases, they tend to a limit of 4.669+.  This helped him
  guess where bifurcation points would be, and saved lots of time.

  When he studied bifurcations of r*sin(PI*p) he found a similar pattern,
  which is not surprising in itself.  However, 4.669+ popped out, again.
  Different formulae, same number ?  Now, THAT's surprising !  He tried
  many other formulae and ALWAYS got 4.669+ - Hot Damn !!!  So hot, in
  fact, that he phoned home and told his Mom it would make him Famous ! He
  also went on to tell other scientists.  The rest is History...

  (It has been conjectured that if Feigenbaum had a copy of Fractint, and
  used it to study bifurcations, he may never have found his Number, as it
  only became obvious from long perusal of hand-written lists of values,
  without the distraction of wild color-cycling effects !).
  We now know that this number is as universal as PI or E. It appears in
  situations ranging from fluid-flow turbulence, electronic oscillators,
  chemical reactions, and even the Mandelbrot Set - yup, fraid so:
  "budding" of the Mandelbrot Set along the negative real axis occurs at
  intervals determined by Feigenbaum's Number, 4.669201660910.....

  Fractint does not make direct use of the Feigenbaum Number (YET !).
  However, it does now reflect the fact that there is a whole sub-species
  of Bifurcation-type fractals.  Those implemented to date, and the
  related formulae, (writing P for pop[n+1] and p for pop[n]) are :

    bifurcation  P =  p + r*fn(p)*(1-fn(p))  Verhulst Bifurcations.
    biflambda    P =      r*fn(p)*(1-fn(p))  Real equivalent of Lambda Sets.
    bif+sinpi    P =  p + r*fn(PI*p)         Population scenario based on...
    bif=sinpi    P =      r*fn(PI*p)         ...Feigenbaum's second formula.
    bifstewart   P =      r*fn(p)*fn(p) - 1  Stewart Map.
    bifmay       P =      r*p / ((1+p)^b)    May Map.

  It took a while for bifurcations to appear here, despite them being over
  a century old, and intimately related to chaotic systems. However, they
  are now truly alive and well in Fractint!


 2.26 Orbit Fractals

  Orbit Fractals are generated by plotting an orbit path in two or three
  dimensional space.

  See Lorenz Attractors (p. 61), Rossler Attractors (p. 62), Henon
  Attractors (p. 62), Pickover Attractors (p. 63), Gingerbreadman
  (p. 63), and Martin Attractors (p. 63).

  The orbit trajectory for these types can be saved in the file ORBITS.RAW
  by invoking Fractint with the "orbitsave=yes" command-line option.  This
  file will be overwritten each time you generate a new fractal, so rename
  it if you want to save it.  A nifty program called Acrospin can read
  these files and rapidly rotate them in 3-D - see Acrospin (p. 203).
