  Changed the internal orbitdelay timer to use a new microsecond timer.
    Changed the logic for controlling sound and orbit speed to make it
    less machine dependent. Use debug=4020 to invoke the old timing logic.

  Modified autologmap so that it ignores symmetry.

  Made the sound= prompts and batch output match the docs.

  Made the colors= information put into PARs the last item in the PAR.

  Added capability for makepar command to detect viewwindows and add to
    PAR file.

  Turned off view windows when the window is either too large or too
  small.

  Added an auto calc feature for the final aspect ratio if it is set to
    zero and the x and y sizes are specified.

  Fixed corners drift of integer fractals by disabling the logic that
     attempts to keep the aspect fixed when zooming.

  The &lt;g&gt; command no longer runs the backwards() routines unless debug=98.

  Added tangent domain protection to integer version of popcorn that
    prevents the "PI box" artifact. Brutal but works.

  Generalized popcorn and popcornjul. There's a lot of possibility in
    these new variations. The function variables are remembered as long as
    you stay within the popcorn family, otherwise they are set to
    defaults. The integer version has an artifact in the F3 mode, probably
    due to tan() being undefined.

  Included contributions from Humberto Baptista. These include Pickover's
    Latoocarfian fractal type, as well as a passes=d[iffusion] option.

  The parser colors variable is now initialized to 256.

  Fixed problem with the floating point Unity fractal type.

  Added Chuck Ebbert's parser speedup.

  Added checks for inside, outside, biomorph, and fillcolor entries larger
    than the number of colors.

  Added fix so that showorbit= can be turned off by restarting Fractint
    with &lt;INS&gt;.

  Adapted the browser so it would work with arbitrary precision images.

  Added cpu/fpu detection for 486 and up.

  Fixed the slow down of palette reset caused by slowing down color
  cycling.
