   In order to help with this situation the Fractint parameter evolver has
   been developed.  It varies those parameters for you and puts the
   results on screen as a grid of small images. You can then choose the
   one which you like best and regenerate it full screen, or if you don't
   like any of the variations, you can try again to see if anything better
   turns up!

   Enough explanations for now, lets see how easy it is to use:

   With the default Mandlebrot set on the screen simply hold down the
   'Alt' key and press the '1' key on the top row (DON'T use the numeric
   keypad to the right, it won't work). You'll see a screen full of images
   generated starting from the middle and spiraling outwards. The perfect
   Mandlebrot set will be in the middle and the others will be warped and
   distorted by having had the initial value of Z perturbed at random...
   but you don't need to know that (which is the whole point really!).

   'Alt-1' produces a low level of mutation of the fractal, only 'mild'
   parameters are changed, those which have a more subtle effect. For much
   wilder variations try pressing 'Alt-7' now. This give the maximum
   available mutation with just about everything being twiddled and
   fiddled to rather dramatic effect as you should now be seeing.

   To select an image for full screen display simply bring up a zoombox by
   pressing 'Page-up' once. The center image will now have a white box
   around it. Hold down the 'Ctrl' key and use the arrow keys to move this
   box around until it's outlining an image you like. Pressing 'B' will
   now exit from evolver mode and redraw the selected image full size. If,
   rather than exiting from evolver mode, you just press 'enter', then a
   whole new set of images is generated, all based around the one you
   selected (which is now the middle image of the new set).

   From a basic point of view that's it!  Just press alt-number to
   scramble things when you're out of inspiration, it works for any of the
   fractal types in fractint including formulae... easy! (chaotic, but
   easy :-) )

   As this is a Fractint feature, there is, of course, a lot more to it
   than the basics described above...

   For a start, there are some handy hotkeys to use, 'F2' and 'F3' are
   used to alter the amount of mutation or the amount by which the
   selected parameters can be varied. 'F2' halves the amount of mutation,
   'F3' doubles it. So if things on-screen are looking a bit samey just
   press 'F3' a few times to crank up the mutation level.

   Using 'F2' to decrease mutation levels is a way of moving towards a
   goal image. Say that a set of images contained one that looked a little
   like, maybe, a cats face and you wished to try and get something more
   cat like.  To achieve this simply select the desired image and press
   'F2'. The newly generated images should be more alike, though probably
   still quite widely varied. With luck, one of the new images will be
   even more cat like. Select this one and press 'F2' again. Continue like
   this, selecting the center image again if there are no improvements in
   the current generation, until eventually all the images are alike and
   you've arrived at your goal (or at least you're probably as close as
