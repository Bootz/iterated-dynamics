  Version 19.5 is a bug-fix release for version 19.4 based on the
    developer's version 19.40 patch 11. As always, we added a few new
    features along with the bug fixes.

  New Comment= command (p. 122). You can automatically set any of the four
    PAR comments, and can include variables in the comments such as the
    much-requested $calctime$ and $date$. Fractint now writes ';;' for
    empty comments above the last comment from the comment= command. This
    prevents comments from moving positions when the PAR is reloaded.

  New recordcolors= command (p. 128). If you place recordcolors=y in your
    SSTOOLS.INI, compressed colors will always be written in your PARS. If
    you want to remember what the map file was (assuming the colors were
    loaded from one), try recordcolors=c. This is exactly like
    recordcolors=y except that the map file (if any) is written to a
    parfile comment.

  Added new parser constants:
    1. whitesq parser constant = (row+col)&amp;1
    2. scrnpix parser constant = (col,row)
    3. scrnmax parser constant = (xdots, ydots)
    4. maxit   parser constant = (maxit,0)

  Added "\" linewrap for formula files.

  Made the round function consistent in all modes. Now round(z) is always
    (floor(x+.5)+i*floor(y+.5)). In version 19.4, in floating point mode
    with type=formula, round() used the coprocessor "nearest or even"
    rounding. Version 19.5 always rounds xxx.5 up.

  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when zooming out with certain functions
    in integer mode.

  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when attempting 3d=overlay without a
    filename in batch mode.

  Fixed a bug that caused part of the video table to not show when
    compiled by Borland.

  Fixed a bug that kept the last image browsed from showing up when you
    regenerate an image and then start the browser again.

  Fixed a bug that loaded images with the wrong aspect ratio when using
    the browser with the view window turned on, and the file image size
    was not the same as the screen image size.
  Version 19.4 is a bug-fix release for version 19.3 based on the
    developer's version 19.30 patch 18. But a few new features did slip in
    when we weren't looking.

  New functions are now available for type=formula and general function
    variable use. They are the rounding functions: floor(), ceil(),
    trunc(), and round()

  New larger showdot "turtle" to enable better seeing which pixel is
    currently being calculated. The syntax is showdot=&lt;color&gt;/&lt;size&gt;, but
    the color parameter can now be one of auto, bright, medium, and dark
