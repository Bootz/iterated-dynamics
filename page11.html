    Removed Bert's truecolor test code used with the test fractal type.

  Patch 7
  Fixed a bug which caused the float only version to omit the name of the
    formula/lsystem/ifs in saved GIFs.  Fixed the julia_inverse fractal
    type broken with the first patch to version 20.0.

    Incorporated Gerald Dobiasovsky's fix to make the background= command
    work.

    Added truecolor support to Xfractint thanks to Rich Thomson and Jean-
    Pierre Demailly.

    Additional Xfractint fixes include the mandelcloud type and
    outside=atan when used with type=mandel.

  Patch 6
  Once again fixed the assignment of hotkeys to video modes so that the
    fractint.cfg file is no longer corrupted.  This problem was caused by
    the section of code dealing with the true-color video modes.

  Patch 5
  Updated the disk video help docs.  The limit of disk video has been
    32767x32767 since version 20.0.

    Fixed the tab and evolver screens so that not using formula parameters
    consecutively starting with p1 now displays the parameters properly.
    The p4 and p5 parameters have still not been added to the evolver.

    Setting directories in sstools.ini can now be done relative to the
    current directory.  For example: .\frm\fract200.frm

  Patch 4
  Modified the per image startup code for the circle type to turn off the
    inside= option if startrail is used.  Since the inside=startrail
    option was locking up Fractint, no backwards compatibility is
    available.

    Made changes to the code for how sizeof() was being used.  This fixes
    a long standing problem with the cellular type in Xfractint.

    Modified the hard coded reading of GIF files in Xfractint to eliminate
    the error message received after patch 3 changed the fractal_info
    structure.

    Fixed a problem with the Xfractint parameter, formula, and lsystem
    screens.

  Patch 3
  Fixed the incremental redraw so that interrupting the redraw no longer
    sets passes=1.

    Added a command line option, nobof=yes, which allows the inside=bof60
    and bof61 options to function like the rest of the inside options.
    With nobof=yes the images in "The Beauty of Fractals" are no longer
    reproduced.
