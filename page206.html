  Fixed inside=zmag and =fmod for arbitrary precision.

  More mandel/julia FPU speedup by assembling the &gt; 8087 code without the
    emulator fixups.  This was also used to speedup the FPU parser code.

  The mandel/julia optimizations are a combination of contributions from
    Rees Acheson (author of MANDELB), Damien Jones, Agner Fog, Terje
    Mathisen, Thomas Jentzsch, and Daniele Paccaloni.  Although it would
    be hard to identify any one person's contribution, they all played a
    great part in the pentium optimizations.

  Added inside=fmod and inside=atan. The inside=atan option should only be
    used with periodicity=0.

  Fixed a bug in loaddac() routine caused because bios doesn't zero top 8
    entries when resetting the dac.

  Added two new features to &lt;b&gt; command. You can now specify "only" at the
     "Record colors?", and added a maxlinelen field to specify how wide
     the parameter file can be.

  Added support for maps to makepar command. Try something like:
     fractint map=lyapunov makepar=mymaps

  Improved color map compression in PAR files. Debug=910 uses old method,
     otherwise uses Sylvie Gallet's fix. Debug=920 uses lossless
     compression for critical use.

  Removed a longstanding but unintended row limit of the encoder which
    resulted in an "interrupted" message when saving long (&gt; 5000 rows)
    files.

  Fixed bug with LodRealPwr in formula parser.

  Speedkey now works with unsorted lists.

  Numbers in sound001.txt file names now increment.

  Added new based data type PFCODE which is a pointer to FCODE. This saves
     memory with the array of parser error messages.

  Fixed bug that caused lockup when extended memory is used without any
    expanded memory.

  Fixed a bug in the spacing of file names in the file selection menu.

  Added Rich Thomson's Xfractint fixes for Silicon Graphics.

  Fixed Julia pointer bug.

  Fixed a bug that caused the zoom box coordinates to be used if a doodad
    was changed with a zoom box on the screen.

  Formula type and inversion now work with large images. Fractint now does
     everything simplgifd does - make an appropriate diskvideo mode, then
     load and save a MIG!!
