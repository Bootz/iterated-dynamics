    Having more than 8M of RAM helps too, that way Windows and FractInt
    aren't fighting over the same memory.

  Hang during startup:
    There might be a problem with Fractint's video detection logic and
    your particular video adapter. Try running with "fractint adapter=xxx"
    where xxx is cga, ega, egamono, mcga, or vga.  If "adapter=vga" works,
    and you really have a SuperVGA adapter capable of higher video modes,
    there are other "adapter=" options for a number of SuperVGA chipsets -
    please see the full selection in Video Parameters (p. 134) for
    details.  If this solves the problem, create an SSTOOLS.INI file with
    the "adapter=xxx" command in it so that the fix will apply to every
    run.
    Another possible cause:  If you install the latest Fractint in say
    directory "newfrac", then run it from another directory with the
    command "\newfrac\fractint", *and* you have an older version of
    fractint.exe somewhere in your DOS PATH, a silent hang is all you'll
    get.  See the notes under the "Cannot find FRACTINT.EXE message"
    problem for the reason.
    Another possibility: try one of the "textsafe" parameter choices
    described in Video Parameters (p. 134).

  Scrambled image when returning from a text mode display:
    If an image which has been partly or completely generated gets partly
    destroyed when you return to it from the menu, help, or the
    information display, please try the various "textsafe" parameter
    options - see Video Parameters (p. 134) for details.  If this cures
    the problem, create an SSTOOLS.INI file with the "textsafe=xxx"
    command so that the fix will apply to every run.

  "Holes" in an image while it is being drawn:
    Little squares colored in your "inside" color, in a pattern of every
    second square of that size, in solid guessing mode, both across and
    down (i.e., 1 out of 4), are a symptom of an image which should be
    calculated with more conservative periodicity checking than the
    default.  See the Periodicity parameter under Image Calculation
    Parameters (p. 126).

  Black bar at top of screen during color cycling on 8086/8088 machines:
    (This might happen intermittently, not every run.)
    "fractint cyclelimit=10" might cure the problem.  If so, increase the
    cyclelimit value (try increasing by 5 or 10 each time) until the
    problem reappears, then back off one step and add that cyclelimit
    value to your SSTOOLS.INI file.

  Other video problems:

    If you are using a VESA driver with your video adapter, the first
    thing to try is the "vesadetect=no" parameter. If that fixes the
    problem, add it to your SSTOOLS.INI file to make the fix permanent.

    It may help to explicitly specify your type of adapter - see the
    "adapter=" parameter in Video Parameters (p. 134).
