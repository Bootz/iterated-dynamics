  Note that the "Look for finite attractor" option on the &lt;Y&gt; options
  screen will override the selected inside option if an attractor is found
  - see Finite Attractors (p. 185).

  OUTSIDE=nnn|iter|real|imag|summ|mult|atan|fmod|tdis
  The classic method of coloring outside the fractal is to color according
  to how many iterations were required before Z reached the bailout value,
  usually 4. This is the method used when OUTSIDE=iter.

  However, when Z reaches bailout the real and imaginary components can be
  at very diferent values.  OUTSIDE=real and OUTSIDE=imag color using the
  iteration value plus the real or imaginary values.  OUTSIDE=summ uses
  the sum of all these values.  These options can give a startling 3d
  quality to otherwise flat images and can change some boring images to
  wonderful ones. OUTSIDE=mult colors by multiplying the iteration by real
  divided by imaginary. There was no mathematical reason for this, it just
  seemed like a good idea.  OUTSIDE=atan colors by determining the angle
  in degrees the last iterated value has with respect to the real axis,
  and using the absolute value.

  OUTSIDE=fmod colors pixels according to the magnitude of the last orbit
  point which is within a set distance from the origin.  Then:
    color = magnitude * colors / closeprox
  The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the same
  calculation as is used for the bailout test.  The value of closeprox can
  be varied interactively.  This feature was contributed by Iain Stirling.
  There is a problem with the mandel fractal type when outside=fmod is
  used with inside=bof6x and bailoutest=real, imag, or manr.  This is
  likely due to changes made in the code so that bof images could be
  reproduced.  Select a different fractal type that produces the default
  mandel image to explore using these parameters.

  OUTSIDE=tdis colors the pixels according to the total distance traveled
  by the orbit.  This feature was suggested by Steve Robinson.

  Outside=nnn sets the color of the exterior to some number of your
  choosing: for example, "OUTSIDE=1" makes all points not INSIDE the
  fractal set to color 1 (blue). Note that defining an OUTSIDE color
  forces any image to be a two-color one: either a point is INSIDE the
  set, or it's OUTSIDE it.

  MAP=[filename]
  Reads in a replacement color map from [filename]. This map replaces the
  default color map of your video adapter. Requires a VGA or higher
  adapter.  The difference between this argument and an alternate map read
  in via &lt;L&gt; in color-command mode is that this one applies to the entire
  run.  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  COLORS=@filename|colorspecification
  Sets colors for the current image, like the &lt;L&gt; function in color
  cycling and palette editing modes. Unlike the MAP= parameter, colors set
  with COLORS= do not replace the default - when you next select a new
  fractal type, colors will revert to their defaults.
