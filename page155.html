  color, if you do not have your 8514/A adapter loaded with its full
  complement of memory you will actually be in 16-color mode. The hardware
  register 16-color modes have not been tested.

  If your 8514/A adapter is not truly register compatible and Fractint
  does not detect this, use of the adapter interface can be forced by
  using afi=y or afi=8514 in your SSTOOLS.INI file.

  Finally, because IBM's adapter interface does not handle drawing single
  pixels very well (we have to draw a 1x1 pixel "box"), generating the
  zoom box when using the interface is excruciatingly slow. Still, it
  works!

  XGA MODES

  The XGA adapter is supported using the VESA/SuperVGA Autodetect modes -
  the XGA looks like just another SuperVGA adapter to Fractint.  The
  supported XGA modes are 640x480x256, 1024x768x16, 1024x768x256,
  800x600x16, and 800x600x256.  Note that the 1024x768x256 mode requires a
  full 1MB of adapter memory, the 1024x768 modes require a high-rez
  monitor, and the 800x600 modes require a multisynching monitor such as
  the NEC 2A.

  TARGA MODES

  TARGA support for Fractint is provided courtesy of Joe McLain and has
  been enhanced with the help of Bruce Goren and Richard Biddle.  To use a
  TARGA board with Fractint, you must define two DOS environment
  variables, "TARGA" and "TARGASET".  The definition of these variables is
  standardized by Truevision; if you have a TARGA board you probably
  already have added "SET" statements for these variables to your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Be aware that there are a LOT of possible TARGA
  configurations, and a LOT of opportunities for a TARGA board and a VGA
  or EGA board to interfere with each other, and we may not have all of
  them smoothed away yet.  Also, the TARGA boards have an entirely
  different color-map scheme than the VGA cards, and at the moment they
  cannot be run through the color-cycling menu. The "MAP=" argument (see
  Color Parameters (p. 128)), however, works with both TARGA and VGA
  boards and enables you to redefine the default color maps with either
  board.

  TARGA+ MODES

  To use the special modes supported for TARGA+ adapters, the TARGAP.SYS
  device driver has to be loaded, and the TPLUS.DAT file (included with
  Fractint) must be in the same directory as Fractint.  The video modes
  with names containing "True Color Autodetect" can be used with the
  Targa+.  You might want to use the command line parameters "tplus=",
  "noninterlaced=", "maxcolorres=", and "pixelzoom=" (see Video Parameters
  (p. 134)) in your SSTOOLS.INI file to modify Fractint's use of the
  adapter.
