  "Smallest window"
  This parameter determines how small the image would have to be onscreen
  before the browser decides not to include it in the selection of files.
  The size is entered in decimal pixels so, for instance, this could be
  set to 0.2 to allow images that are up to around three maximum zooms
  away (depending on the current video resolution) to be loaded instantly.
  Set this to 0 to enable all sub images to be detected.  This can lead to
  a very cluttered screen!  The primary use is in conjunction with the
  search file mask (see below) to allow location of high magnification
  images within an overall view (like the whole Mset).

  "Smallest box"
  This determines when the image location is shown as crosshairs rather
  than a rather small box.  Set this according to how good your eyesight
  is (probably worse than before you started staring at fractals all the
  time :-)) or the resolution of your screen.  WARNING the crosshairs
  routine centers the cursor on one corner of the image box at the moment
  so this looks misleading if set too large.
  "Search Mask"
  Sets the file name pattern which the browser searches, this can be used
  to search out the location of a file by setting this to the filename and
  setting smallest image to 0 (see above).


 5.21 Passes Parameters

  PERIODICITY=no|show|nnn
  Controls periodicity checking (see Periodicity Logic (p. 166)).  "no"
  turns it off, "show" lets you see which pixels were painted as "inside"
  due to being caught by periodicity.  Specifying a number causes a more
  conservative periodicity test (each increase of 1 divides test tolerance
  by 2).  Entering a negative number lets you turn on "show" with that
  number. Type lambdafn function=exp needs periodicity turned off to be
  accurate -- there may be other cases.

  A non-zero value of the "periodicity=" option causes "passes=o" to not
  plot orbits that have reached the bailout conditions or where an orbit
  goes off the visible area of the image.  A zero value of periodicity
  will plot all orbits except as modified by orbitdelay and orbitinterval.

  ORBITDELAY=&lt;nn&gt;
  This option controls how many orbits are computed before the orbits are
  displayed on the screen when using the "passes=o" option, or the fractal
  types mandelcloud and dynamic.  This allows the orbits to settle down
  before plotting starts.

  This option also slows down the display of orbits using the &lt;O&gt; command
  for folks with hot new computers. Units are in 1/10000 seconds per orbit
  point.  ORBITDELAY=10 therefore allows you to see each pixel's orbit
  point for about one millisecond. For best display of orbits, try
  passes=1 and a moderate resolution such as 320x200.  Note that the first
  time you press the 'O' key with the 'orbitdelay' function active, your
  computer will pause for a half-second or so to calibrate a high-
  resolution timer.
