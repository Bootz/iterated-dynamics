  Versions 18.1 and 18.2 are bug-fix releases for version 18.0.  Changes
  from 18.1 to 18.2 include:

   The &lt;b&gt; command now causes filenames only to be written in PAR files.

   Fractint will now search directories in the PATH for files not found in
   the requested the requested directory or the current directory. If you
   place .MAP, .FRM, etc. in directories in your PATH, then Fractint will
   find them.

   Fixed bug that caused fractals using PI symmetry to fail at high
   resolution.

   Fractals interrupted with &lt;3&gt; or &lt;r&gt; can now resume.

   The palette editor's &lt;u&gt; (undo) now works.

   The &lt;s&gt; command in orbit/Julia window mode is no longer case sensitive.

   Added warnings that the POV-Ray output is obsolete (but has been left
   in).  Use POV-Ray's height field facility instead or create and convert
   RAW files.

   Fixed several IFS bugs.

  Changes from 18.0 to 18.1 include:

   Overlay tuning - the Mandelbrot/Julia Set fractals are now back up to
   17.x speeds

   Disk Video modes now work correctly with VESA video adapters (they used
   to use the same array for different purposes, confusing each other)

   1024x768x256 and 2048x2048x256 disk video modes work again

   Parameter-file processing no longer crashes Fractint if it attempts to
   run a formula requiring access to a non-existent FRM file

   IFS arrays no longer overrun their array space

   type=cellular fixes

   "autologmap=2" now correctly picks up the minimum color

   The use of disk-video mode with random-access fractal types is now
   legal (it generates a warning message but lets you proceed if you
   really want to)

   The Lsystems "spinning-wheel" now spins slower (removing needless
   overhead)
