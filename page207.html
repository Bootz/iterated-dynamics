  Fixed a long standing bug in the popcorn fractal type and added
    backwards compatibility.  Revised the popcorn type docs to clarify
    that when the view window is used, it is possible to see orbits
    outside the "box".

  Fixed a bug that was causing garbage to be read when a non-Fractint GIF
    image was read.

  Replaced the lzw logic with code based on the UNIX compress. This should
    eliminate very rare but very frustrating encoder problems.

  Added a function one() to formula parser, to complement ident() and
    zero().  The new function returns (1,0), and, like ident() and zero(),
    is only available as a choice for fn1, fn2, fn3 or fn4.

  Disabled symmetry for synchronous orbits.

  Moved encoder default color palettes from near memory to overlayed data.

  Changed the grid lookups to a function. Fixed diskvideo viewwindows bug.
    Moved zoom box function out of assembler to c.

  Changed the direction of single color cycling when in color cycling
  mode.

  Added command line option orgfrmdir=[directory path]. When used,
    Fractint's search for formulas will make a final check of the
    appropriate Orgform compilation file in the specified directory (e.g.
    for a formula with the name "abc", the only file searched in the
    specified directory will be _a.frm). This feature will significantly
    reduce the time taken to find a formula for users of the compilation.

    For more about the Orgform compilation, see  Other Fractal Products
    (p. 199).

  Added a new minstack=&lt;nnnn&gt; command. Default value is 1100. This is the
    minimum number of bytes returned by the stackavail() function required
    in order to do another SOI recursion. People who get bad SOI results
    at high resolutions should increase this value until the symptoms go
    away.

  Fixed the FPUatan bug that has been in the code in calmanfp.asm since it
    was written.  It turns out that the major problem was that the FPU
    stack was being overrun.

  Rewrote the Mandelbrot FPU code.  Fixed the FPU versions of inside=
    real, imag, mult, and summ.  Incremented the version number so the fix
    could be backwards compatible.

  Added symmetry to Escher-Julia type.

  Editpal changes from Andrew McCarthy.  Removed IIT coprocessor support.

  Parser changes: New code is only used to determine which functions and
    variables will appear at top of "z" screen for a formula. Variable
    names in fomrulas must now start with a letter or "_". Error checking
