  After pressing &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;, highlight an entry and press &lt;Enter&gt; to load
  it, or press &lt;F6&gt; to change to another parameter file.

  Note that parameter file entries specify all calculation related
  parameters, but do not specify things like the video mode - the image
  will be plotted in your currently selected mode.

  &lt;B&gt;

  The &lt;B&gt; command saves the parameters required to describe the currently
  displayed image, which can subsequently be used with the &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;
  command to recreate it.

  After you press &lt;B&gt;, Fractint prompts for:

    Parameter file:  The name of the file to store the parameters in.  You
    should use some name like "myimages" instead of fractint.par, so that
    your images are kept separate from the ones released with new versions
    of Fractint. You can use the PARMFILE= command in SSTOOLS.INI to set
    the default parameter file name to "myimages" or whatever.  (See
    "Setting Defaults (SSTOOLS.INI File)" (p. 120) and "parmfile=" in
    "File Parameters" (p. 133).)

    Name:  The name you want to assign to the entry, to be displayed when
    the &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt; command is used.

    Main comment:  A comment to be shown beside the entry in the &lt;@&gt;
    command display.

    Second, Third, and Fourth comment:  Additional comments to store in
    the file with the entry. These comments go in the file only, and are
    not displayed by the &lt;@&gt; command. You can set these comments from the
    command line - see Comment= Command (p. 122).

    Record colors?:  Whether color information should be included in the
    entry. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint is what you
    want.  Allowed values are:
    "no" - Don't record colors.
    "@mapfilename" - When these parameters are used, load colors from the
       named color map file. This is the default if you are currently
       using colors from a color map file.
    "yes" - Record the colors in detail. This is the default when you've
       changed the display colors by using the palette editor or by color
       cycling. The only reason that this isn't what Fractint always does
       for the &lt;B&gt; command is that color information can be bulky - up to
       nearly 3K of disk space per map - which adds up to a lot for many
       images. Smooth-shaded ranges of colors are compressed, so if that's
       used a lot in an image the color information won't be as bulky.
    "only" - Record only the colors in the PAR file, without any other
       parameters. This is useful for converting color maps to PAR
       entries.

    # of colors:  This only matters if "Record colors?" is set to "yes".
    It specifies the number of colors to record. Recording less colors
    will take less space. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint
    is what you want. You might want to increase it in some cases, e.g. if
