     Ctrl-Enter      'Zoom-out' - expands the image so that your current image
                      is positioned inside the current zoom-box location.
     Ctrl-Pad+/Pad-  Rotates the inner Zoom Box.
     Ctrl-PgUp/PgDn  Changes inner Zoom Box vertical size.
     Ctrl-Home/End   Changes inner Zoom Box shape.
     Ctrl-Ins/Del    Changes inner Zoom Box color.
     Ctrl-E          Brings up the evolver screen.
     Space           Brings up the evolver screen once in evolver mode.
     B               Turns off evolver if in evolver mode.
     F2              Halves the amount of mutation.
     F3              Doubles the amount of mutation.
     F4              Generates fewer, bigger images.
     F5              Generates more, smaller images.
     F6              Switches to/from 'spread' mode with fewer mutations around
                      the middle.




 1.16 RDS Commands

  The following keystrokes function while viewing an RDS image:

  &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt;   -- Toggle calibration bars on and off.
  &lt;Ctrl-s&gt; or &lt;k&gt;      -- Return to RDS Parameters Screen.
  &lt;s&gt;                  -- Save RDS image, then restore original.
  &lt;c&gt;, &lt;+&gt;, &lt;-&gt;        -- Color cycle RDS image.
  Other keys           -- Exit RDS mode, restore original image, and pass
                          keystroke on to main menu.

 1.17 Hints

  Remember, you do NOT have to wait for the program to finish a full
  screen display before entering a command. If you see an interesting spot
  you want to zoom in on while the screen is half-done, don't wait -- do
  it! If you think after seeing the first few lines that another video
  mode would look better, go ahead -- Fractint will shift modes and start
  the redraw at once. When it finishes a display, it beeps and waits for
  your next command.

  In general, the most interesting areas are the "border" areas where the
  colors are changing rapidly. Zoom in on them for the best results. The
  first Mandelbrot-set (default) fractal image has a large, solid-colored
  interior that is the slowest to display; there's nothing to be seen by
  zooming there.

  Plotting time is directly proportional to the number of pixels in a
  screen, and hence increases with the resolution of the video mode.  You
  may want to start in a low-resolution mode for quick progress while
  zooming in, and switch to a higher-resolution mode when things get
  interesting. Or use the solid guessing mode and pre-empt with a zoom
  before it finishes. Plotting time also varies with the maximum iteration
