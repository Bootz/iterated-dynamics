  ATTACK=nn
  This controls the time taken for a note to hit full volume after being
  triggered on. Low values give a punchy percussive sound while long
  values give a softer bowed sound. If attack time is set too long and
  orbitdelay is low then notes are played too fast to ever achieve any
  volume and the net result is low or non existent output. To put it
  another way, if orbitdelay is low then this value should be low also.

  DECAY=nn
  This controls the time taken for a note to die down to the sustain
  level.  Setting this time too low may produce a rhythmic click between
  notes.  The attack and decay values don't allow much fine control.

  SUSTAIN=nn
  This controls the volume level at which a note is held.

  SRELEASE=nn
  This controls the delay in time for releasing a note.  A release value
  of 15 seems to equate to 'never let the note release' on the machine
  used to develop the sound card drivers.  But, as ever, with other
  manufacturer's emulations your mileage may vary.

  VOLUME=nn
  It is possible to adjust the volume of an FM synth card.  This has no
  effect on the PC speaker.

  ATTENUATE=none|low|mid|high
  On an FM synth card it is possible to attenuate the high pitched notes.
  The default is none.  The low value attenuates at 1.5 dB/octave, the mid
  at 3.0 dB/octave, and the high at 6.0 dB/octave.

  SCALEMAP=nn/nn/nn/...
  The scale map list is a way of controlling which notes are played by
  fractint and only has any effect if note quantisation is switched on in
  the basic sound parameters screen. It can be very useful when the
  polyphony is up and the chords you're getting are more like dischords.
  :-)

  The way it works is this: When a sound is played with frequency
  quantisation on its frequency is rounded to the nearest 'proper' note on
  the musical scale, this note number is then looked up in the scale map
  table and substituted by the note indicated in that entry of the table.
