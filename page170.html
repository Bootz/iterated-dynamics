  various miscellaneous bits of information that allow toggling between
  Julia and Mandelbrot or toggling between the various kinds of math used
  in implementation.

  That sounds pretty flexible, but there is one drawback - you have to be
  a C programmer and have a C compiler to make use of it! So we took it a
  step further, and designed a built-in high level compiler, so that you
  can enter the formulas for the various functions in a formula file in a
  straightforward algebra-like language, and Fractint will compile them
  and bolt them in for you!

  There is a terrible down side to this flexibility.  Fractint users
  everywhere are going berserk. Fractal-inventing creativity is running
  rampant. Proposals for new fractal types are clogging the mail and the
  telephones.

  All we can say is that non-productivity software has never been so
  potent, and we're sorry, it's our fault!

  Fractint was compiled using Microsoft C 7.0 and Microsoft Assembler 6.0,
  using the "Medium" model. Note that the assembler code uses the "C"
  model option added to version 5.1, and must be assembled with the /MX or
  /ML switch to link with the "C" code. Because it has become too large to
  distribute comfortably as a single compressed file, and because many
  downloaders have no intention of ever modifying it, Fractint is now
  distributed as two files: one containing FRACTINT.EXE, auxiliary files
  and this document, and another containing complete source code
  (including a .MAK file and MAKEFRAC.BAT).  See Distribution of Fractint
  (p. 195).
