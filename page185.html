  inside=period colors pixels according to the length of their eventual
  cycle.  For example, points that approach a fixed point have color=1.
  Points that approach a 2-cycle have color=2.  Points that do not
  approach a cycle during the iterations performed have color=maxit.  This
  option works best with a fairly large number of iterations.

  inside=atan colors by determining the angle in degrees the last iterated
  value has with respect to the real axis, and using the absolute value.
  This feature should be used with periodicity=0

  INSIDE=EPSCROSS|STARTRAIL

  Kenneth Hooper has written a paper entitled "A Note On Some Internal
  Structures Of The Mandelbrot Set" published in "Computers and Graphics",
  Vol 15, No.2, pp. 295-297.  In that article he describes Clifford
  Pickover's "epsilon cross" method which creates some mysterious plant-
  like tendrils in the Mandelbrot set. The algorithm is this. In the
  escape-time calculation of a fractal, if the orbit comes within .01 of
  the Y-axis, the orbit is terminated and the pixel is colored green.
  Similarly, the pixel is colored yellow if it approaches the X-axis.
  Strictly speaking, this is not an "inside" option because a point
  destined to escape could be caught by this bailout criterion.

  The test distance, 0.01, can now be changed interactively on the &lt;x&gt;
  screen and via the proximity=&lt;nnn&gt; command line parameter. A negative
  value of the test distance triggers an alternative variation of epsilon
  cross that colors the epsilon bands with the iteration; otherwise they
  are colored normally to maintain compatibility.

  Hooper has another coloring scheme called "star trails" that involves
  detecting clusters of points being traversed by the orbit. A table of
  tangents of each orbit point is built, and the pixel colored according
  to how many orbit points are near the first one before the orbit flies
  out of the cluster.  This option looks fine with maxiter=16, which
  greatly speeds the calculation.

  Both of these options should be tried with the outside color fixed
  (outside=&lt;nnn&gt;) so that the "lake" structure revealed by the algorithms
  can be more clearly seen. Epsilon Cross is fun to watch with boundary
  tracing turned on - even though the result is incorrect it is
  interesting! Shucks - what does "incorrect" mean in chaos theory
  anyway?!

  FINITE ATTRACTORS

  Many of Fractint's fractals involve the iteration of functions of
  complex numbers until some "bailout" value is exceeded, then coloring
  the associated pixel according to the number of iterations performed.
  This process identifies which values tend to infinity when iterated, and
  gives us a rough measure of how "quickly" they get there.

  In dynamical terms, we say that "Infinity is an Attractor", as many
  initial values get "attracted" to it when iterated.  The set of all
  points that are attracted to infinity is termed The Basin of Attraction
  of Infinity.  The coloring algorithm used divides this Basin of
  Attraction into many distinct sets, each a single band of one color,
