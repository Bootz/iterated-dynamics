    in addition to the previously-supported color number value.

  The &lt;g&gt; command now remembers the last command.

  Added the ability to load images into a view window.  This can be used
    with the browser to browse images larger than the current image.

  Added George Martin's new integrated entry-finding code. Fractint is now
    more tolerant of text between entries, and the internal code is much
    cleaner than before.

  Added Bert Tyler's new VESA truecolor video drivers. These don't do
    anything yet; we've just added the video drivers for testing. Work
    goes on ...
    To test out the new modes, try fractint debug=500 type=test and select
    a new truecolor mode. They only work with video boards having VESA
    truecolor support. Some "non-standard VESA" modes (an unfortunate
    oxymoron if there ever was one) can also be supported by editing
    FRACTINT.CFG. These vendor-specific "VESA" modes tend to make Bert,
    our video expert, real grumpy ...

  Now for the squashed bugs report:

  Ranges is working again.

  Fixed a browser bug that caused a crash when the browser cross-hairs
    become too small.

  Fixed a bug which put the browser into an infinite loop if the history
    feature was used to try and access a deleted or renamed image that was
    still in the history stack.

  Fixed bug that caused any command with greater than 16 parameters to
    fail, most notably textcolors and ranges.

  Fixed a center-mag&lt;-&gt;corners conversion bug that occurred with rotated
    images.  arbitrary precision also (test with debug=3200).

  Fixed bug that allowed the matherr debugging file to grow arbitrarily
    large.  Matherr file is limited to 100 messages for each fractal.

  Fixed bug that affected some Icons3d types, which were broken due to a
    very subtle bug in apparently good code caused by the compiler
    optimizer.

  Version 19.3 is a bug-fix release for version 19.2 based on the
    developer's version 19.21 patch 30.

  The biggest changes from 19.2 to 19.3 are the fixing of the color logmap
    function for maximum iterations greater than 32K, and a large increase
    in the maximum size of an individual formula and the maximum number of
    entries in formula, parameter, ifs, and lsystem files.

  Changes from 19.2 to 19.3 include:
