  alternating shades showing changes in the number of iterations needed to
  attract an orbit. Some people like stripes and some don't, as always,
  Fractint gives you a choice!

  The coloring of the plot shows the "basins of attraction" for each root
  of the polynomial -- i.e., an initial guess within any area of a given
  color would lead you to one of the roots. As you can see, things get a
  bit weird along certain radial lines or "spokes," those being the lines
  between actual roots. By "weird," we mean infinitely complex in the good
  old fractal sense. Zoom in and see for yourself.

  This fractal type is symmetric about the origin, with the number of
  "spokes" depending on the order you select. It uses floating-point math
  if you have an FPU, or a somewhat slower integer algorithm if you don't
  have one.


 2.6 Newton

  (type=newton)

  The generating formula here is identical to that for newtbasin (p. 47),
  but the coloring scheme is different. Pixels are colored not according
  to the root that would be "converged on" if you started using Newton's
  formula from that point, but according to the iteration when the value
  is close to a root.  For example, if the calculations for a particular
  pixel converge to the 7th root on the 23rd iteration, NEWTBASIN will
  color that pixel using color #7, but NEWTON will color it using color
  #23.

  If you have a 256-color mode, use it: the effects can be much livelier
  than those you get with type=newtbasin, and color cycling becomes, like,
  downright cosmic. If your "corners" choice is symmetrical, Fractint
  exploits the symmetry for faster display.

  The applicable "params=" values are the same as newtbasin. Try
  "params=4."  Other values are 3 through 10. 8 has twice the symmetry and
  is faster. As with newtbasin, an FPU helps.


 2.7 Complex Newton

  (type=complexnewton/complexbasin)

  Well, hey, "Z^n - 1" is so boring when you can use "Z^a - b" where "a"
  and "b" are complex numbers!  The new "complexnewton" and "complexbasin"
  fractal types are just the old "newton" (p. 48) and "newtbasin"
  (p. 47) fractal types with this little added twist.  When you select
  these fractal types, you are prompted for four values (the real and
  imaginary portions of "a" and "b").  If "a" has a complex portion, the
  fractal has a discontinuity along the negative axis - relax, we finally
  figured out that it's *supposed* to be there!
