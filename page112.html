  Then there are three scaling factors in percent. Initially, leave the X
  and Y axes alone and play with Z, now the vertical axis, which
  translates into surface "roughness."  High values of Z make spiky, on-
  beyond-Alpine mountains and improbably deep valleys; low values make
  gentle, rolling terrain. Negative roughness is legal: if you're doing an
  M-set image and want Mandelbrot Lake to be below the ground, instead of
  eerily floating above, try a roughness of about -30%.

  Next we need a water level -- really a minimum-color value that performs
  the function "if (color &lt; waterlevel) color = waterlevel". So it plots
  all colors "below" the one you choose at the level of that color, with
  the effect of filling in "valleys" and converting them to "lakes."

  Now we enter a perspective distance, which you can think of as the
  "distance" from your eye to the image. A zero value (the default) means
  no perspective calculations, which allows use of a faster algorithm.
  Perspective distance is not available if you have selected a ray tracing
  option.

  For non-zero values, picture a box with the original X-Y plane of your
  flat fractal on the bottom, and your 3D fractal inside. A perspective
  value of 100% places your eye right at the edge of the box and yields
  fairly severe distortion, like a close view through a wide-angle lens.
  200% puts your eye as far from the front of the box as the back is
  behind.  300% puts your eye twice as far from the front of the box as
  the back is, etc. Try about 150% for reasonable results. Much larger
  values put you far away for even less distortion, while values smaller
  than 100% put you "inside" the box. Try larger values first, and work
  your way in.

  Next, you are prompted for two types of X and Y shifts (now back in the
  plane of your screen) that let you move the final image around if you'd
  like to re-center it. The first set, x and y shift with perspective,
  move the image and the effect changes the perspective you see. The
  second set, "x and y adjust without perspective", move the image but do
  not change perspective.  They are used just for positioning the final
  image on the screen. Shifting of any type is not available if you have
  selected a ray tracing option.


 4.5 3D Color Parameters

  You are asked for a range of "transparent" colors, if any. This option
  is most useful when using the 3D Overlay Mode (p. 115).  Enter the color
  range (minimum and maximum value) for which you do not want to overwrite
  whatever may already be on the screen. The default is no transparency
  (overwrite everything).

  Now, for the final option. This one will smooth the transition between
  colors by randomizing them and reduce the banding that occurs with some
  maps. Select the value of randomize to between 0 (for no effect) and 7
  (to randomize your colors almost beyond use). 3 is a good starting
  point.
