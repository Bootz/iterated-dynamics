    Pulled the WinFract version 18.21 source into the CVS repository
    source tree.  This code now runs but still has many many bugs.

  Patch 3 to Version 20.4.0
  Started the cleanup of the docs.  Cleaned up the map directory.

    Fixed the Xfractint Makefile so that install would run.  Added an
    uninstall.

    Fixed Xfractint so that it can be run from an arbitrary directory and
    still use the directory settings in sstools.ini.

  Patch 2 to Version 20.4.0
  Fixed the display coordinates so they won't change, after an image had
    been zoomed, when the maintain screen coordinates parameter is set to
    yes.

    Fixed the corner parameter screen and image parameter screen so that
    rotating and/or skewing now doesn't get reset when changes are made.

  Patch 1 to Version 20.4.0
  Added the mathtolerance and orbit_delay parameters to values written to
    PARs and GIFs.

    Fixed how a mathtolerance parameter with a slash and a second number,
    but no first number is read in.  The slash was being interpreted as a
    double.

    Stole the &lt;p&gt; key for use by passes options.  If you are brave enough
    to try it, printing is still available using &lt;ctl-p&gt;.

    Put periodicity and orbit delay on the new &lt;p&gt; screen.  There are
    currently two drawing modes available for the passes=orbits option.
    The rect(angle) method plots the orbits in a rectangle that can be
    zoomed, rotated, and skewed using the &lt;F6&gt; corner parameter screen,
    and the straight line method plots the orbits between two points
    specified on the &lt;F6&gt; corner parameter screen.  The orbit interval
    parameter plots every nth orbit.  The maintain screen coordinates
    parameter lets you zoom into an image changing the coordinates of the
    line or rectangle used to generate the image, but keeps the display
    coordinates, set on the &lt;F2&gt; screen, the same.

    Updated the docs for center-mag and corners because center-mag is now
    the default.

    Restructured the source to make it easier to maintain.

  Version 20.4.0
  Incremented the version number to accommodate backwards compatibility
    for the mandel based per-pixel routines that were not setting the Y
    variable.

    Added a passes=o option that draws an image by plotting the orbits of
    the escape time fractals and leaving them on the screen.  This
    technique uses the same coordinates to draw an image as the other
    passes options, sets "passes=1" and no symmetry, and then plots the
