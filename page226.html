     properly during fractal-type selection for some fractal types.

  Version 17.1, 3/92

   - fixed a bug which caused PCs with no FPU to lock up when they
   attempted
     to use some fractal types.
   - fixed a color-cycling bug which caused the palette to single-step
     when you pressed ESCAPE to exit color-cycling.
   - fixed the action of the '&lt;' and '&gt;' keys during color-cycling.

  Version 17.0, 2/92

  - New fractal types (but of course!):

  Lyapunov Fractals from Roy Murphy (see Lyapunov Fractals (p. 73) for
  details)

  'BifStewart' (Stewart Map bifurcation) fractal type and new bifurcation
  parameters (filter cycles, seed population) from Kevin Allen.

  Lorenz3d1, Lorenz3d3, and Lorenz3d4 fractal types from Scott Taylor.
  Note that a bug in the Lorenz3d1 fractal prevents zooming-out from
  working with it at the moment.

  Martin, Circle, and Hopalong (culled from Dewdney's Scientific American
  Article)

  Lots of new entries in fractint.par.

  New ".L" files (TILING.L, PENROSE.L)

  New 'rand()' function added to the 'type=formula' parser

  - New fractal generation options:

  New 'Tesseral' calculation algorithm (use the 'X' option list to select
  it) from  Chris Lusby Taylor.

  New 'Fillcolor=' option shows off Boundary Tracing and Tesseral
  structure

  inside=epscross and inside=startrail options taken from a paper by
  Kenneth Hooper, with credit also to Clifford Pickover

  New Color Postscript Printer support from Scott Taylor.

  Sound= command now works with &lt;O&gt;rbits and &lt;R&gt;ead commands.

  New 'orbitdelay' option in X-screen and command-line interface

  New "showdot=nn" command-line option that displays the pixel currently
  being worked on using the specified color value (useful for those
  lloooonngg images being calculated using solid guessing - "where is it
  now?").
