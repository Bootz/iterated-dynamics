  To vary the width of the band, drag up and down with the right button
  held down.  Slower machines may show some 'lag' during this operation,
  especially if they have no math co-processor, so watch out as the mouse
  movements get buffered.

  Once you've got the band in a satisfactory position then double click
  the left button to fix it in place.  Continue like this for as long as
  you like, adding different colours to the grey palette.  You'll notice
  how the band relates to the existing colour, the RGB values give the
  middle colour which are then smoothly shaded out to the colours at the
  ends of the band. This can lead to some sudden jumps in the shading as
  the band is moved about the screen and the edges come to overlap
  different areas of colour.

  For really violent jumps in shading try starting with an image that has
  areas that change chaotically, such as a Mandlbrot set. You'll see what
  I mean when you move the cross hairs into an area close to the 'lake'
  where the change in value from one pixel to the next is sudden, chaotic
  and large. Watch out! the strobing effect can be somewhat disturbing.
  This is nothing to worry about but just a consequence of the
  manipulation of the palette and the way in which the colour bands are
  calculated.

  I hope that you'll find this a useful tool in colouring an image.
  Remember that the 'h' key can be used to hide the palette box and expose
  the whole image.
