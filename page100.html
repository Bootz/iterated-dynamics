   it's possible to get with that fractal type).

   As you look for more details in the images it is useful to reduce the
   number of images per generation, thus producing larger sub images.
   Pressing 'F4' will reduce the number of images per side on the grid by
   two and pressing 'F5' increments the gridsize similarly.

   'F6' will switch between normal random mutation and 'spread' random
   mutation.  In 'spread' mode the amount of mutation allowed in an image
   is varied according to each images position in the grid. Those images
   near the center are allowed a lesser degree of freedom of mutation than
   those around the outside. This produces a sea of images, stable at the
   center with wilder variations around the edges. This mode is best used
   with larger gridsizes and becomes completely silly at a gridsize of
   three!

   'Ctrl-e' brings up the evolver control screen on which you have manual
   access to the evolution parameters varied by the hotkeys described
   above.
   These are:

      Gridsize.            The number of sub images per side of the
      screen. Use
                           odd numbers only.

      Max Mutation         The maximum amount by which a parameter may be
      varied

      Mutation Reduction   The Max mutation value is multiplied by this
      between
                           generations. This can be used to automatically goal
                           seek without having to use the 'F2' key.

      Grouting             Turns on or off the gap between sub images, at
      large
                           values of gridsize this can reclaim valuable screen
                           area for display use.

   Pressing 'F6' brings up a screen from which you can control what
   parameters get varied and in what manner. You'll notice that as well as
   the mutation modes 'random' and 'spread' there are other ways of
   stirring things around, read on......

   As well as randomly mutating parameter values (referred to as 'evolver
   mode' or just 'evolving') a chosen set of parameters can be varied
   steadily across the screen thus allowing the user to explore what
   happens as a parameter is slowly changed ('explorer mode' or
   'exploring'). For example, to get acquainted with parameter exploring
   and produce a map of the Julia sets, try this:
   Start Fractint and set the type to Julia and the resolution higher than
   320x200, once the default Julia set has been generated, press 'Ctrl-e'
   to bring up the evolver/explorer control panel.

   Set evolve mode to yes and then press 'F6' to bring up the screen that
   allows you to choose what gets varied.
