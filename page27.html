  Rotate the palette one step.  By default colors 1 through 255 inclusive
  are rotated.  This range can be over-ridden with the "cyclerange"
  parameter, the &lt;Y&gt; options screen, or the &lt;O&gt; command described below.

  "&lt;" "&gt;"
  Rotate the palette continuously (until next keystroke)

  &lt;O&gt;
  Set the color cycling range to the range of colors currently defined by
  the color registers.

  &lt;C&gt;
  Enter Color-Cycling Mode.  When you invoke color-cycling from here, it
  will subsequently return to palette-editing when you &lt;Esc&gt; from it.  See
  Color Cycling Commands (p. 23).

  &lt;=&gt;
  Create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the colors selected by
  the two color registers.

  &lt;M&gt;
  Specify a gamma value for the shading created by &lt;=&gt;.

  &lt;D&gt;
  Duplicate the inactive color register's values to the active color
  register.

  &lt;T&gt;
  Stripe-shade - create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the two
  color registers, setting only every Nth register.  After hitting &lt;T&gt;,
  hit a numeric key from 2 to 9 to specify N.  For example, if you press
  &lt;T&gt; &lt;3&gt;, smooth shading is done between the two color registers,
  affecting only every 3rd color between them.  The other colors between
  them remain unchanged.

  &lt;W&gt;
  Convert current palette to gray-scale.  (If the &lt;X&gt; or &lt;Y&gt; exclude
  ranges described later are in force, only the active range of colors is
  converted to gray-scale.)

  &lt;Shift-F2&gt; ... &lt;Shift-F9&gt;
  Store the current palette in a temporary save area associated with the
  function key.  The temporary save palettes are useful for quickly
  comparing different palettes or the effect of some changes - see next
  command.  The temporary palettes are only remembered until you exit from
  palette-editing mode.
  Starting with version 19.6, when palette editing mode is entered, the
  original palette is stored in the area associated with F2.

  &lt;F2&gt; ... &lt;F9&gt;
  Restore the palette from a temporary save area.  If you haven't
  previously saved a palette for the function key, you'll get a simple
  grey scale.
