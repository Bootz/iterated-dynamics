  beasties (see below). These types are produced with formulas built from
  the functions z^z, z^n, sin(z), and e^z for complex z. Types with
  "power" or "pwr" in their name have an exponent value as a third
  parameter. For example, type=manzpower params=0/0/2 is our old friend
  the classical Mandelbrot, and type=manzpower params=0/0/4 is the Quartic
  Mandelbrot. Other values of the exponent give still other fractals.
  Since these WERE the original "biomorph" types, we should give an
  example.  Try:

      FRACTINT type=manfn+zsqrd biomorph=0 corners=-8/8/-6/6 function=sin

  to see a big biomorph digesting little biomorphs!


 2.20 Pickover Popcorn

  (type=popcorn/popcornjul)

  Here is another Pickover idea. This one computes and plots the orbits of
  the dynamic system defined by:

      x(n+1) = x(n) - real(h * fn1( y(n) + fn2(C * y(n) ))
                    - imag(h * fn3( x(n) + fn4(C * x(n) ))
      y(n+1) = y(n) - real(h * fn3( x(n) + fn4(C * x(n) ))
                    - imag(h * fn1( y(n) + fn2(C * y(n) ))

  In the original the functions were: sin, tan, sin, tan, and C was 3.

  The initializers x(0) and y(0) equal to ALL the complex values within
  the "corners" values, and h=.01.  ALL these orbits are superimposed,
  resulting in "popcorn" effect.  You may want to use a maxiter value less
  than normal - Pickover recommends a value of 50.  Although you can zoom
  and rotate popcorn, the results may not be what you'd expect, due to the
  superimposing of orbits and arbitrary use of color.  The orbits
  frequently occur outside of the screen boundaries.  To view the fractal
  in its entirety, set the preview display to "yes" using the "V" command.

  As a bonus, type=popcornjul shows the Julia set generated by these same
  equations with the usual escape-time coloring. Turn on orbit viewing
  with the "O" command, and as you watch the orbit pattern you may get
  some insight as to where the popcorn comes from.


 2.21 Peterson Variations

  (type=marksmandel, marksjulia, cmplxmarksmand, cmplxmarksjul,
  marksmandelpwr, tim's_error)

  These fractal types are contributions of Mark Peterson. MarksMandel and
  MarksJulia are two families of fractal types that are linked in the same
  manner as the classic Mandelbrot/Julia sets: each MarksMandel set can be
  considered as a mapping into the MarksJulia sets, and is linked with the
  spacebar toggle. The basic equation for these sets is:
        Z(n+1) = (lambda^(exp-1) * Z(n)^2) + lambda
  where Z(0) = 0.0 and lambda is (x + iy) for MarksMandel. For MarksJulia,
  Z(0) = (x + iy) and lambda is a constant (taken from the MarksMandel
