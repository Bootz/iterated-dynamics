  INSIDE=BOF60|BOF61|ZMAG|FMOD|PERIOD|ATAN

  Here is an *ATTEMPTED* explanation of what the inside=bof60 and
  inside=bof61 options do. This explanation is hereby dedicated to Adrian
  Mariano, who badgered it out of us! For the *REAL* explanation, see
  "Beauty of Fractals", page 62.

  Let p(z) be the function that is repeatedly iterated to generate a
  fractal using the escape-time algorithm.  For example, p(z) = z^2+c in
  the case of a Julia set. Then let pk(z) be the result of iterating the
  function p for k iterations. (The "k" should be shown as a superscript.)
  We could also use the notation pkc(z) when the function p has a
  parameter c, as it does in our example.  Now hold your breath and get
  your thinking cap on. Define a(c) = inf{|pkc(0)|:k=1,2,3,...}. In
  English - a(c) is the greatest lower bound of the images of zero of as
  many iterations as you like. Put another way, a(c) is the closest to the
  origin any point in the orbit starting with 0 gets. Then the index (c)
  is the value of k (the iteration) when that closest point was achieved.
  Since there may be more than one, index(c) is the least such. Got it?
  Good, because the "Beauty of Fractals" explanation of this, is, ahhhh,
  *TERSE* ! Now for the punch line. Inside=bof60 colors the lake
  alternating shades according to the level sets of a(c).  Each band
  represents solid areas of the fractal where the closest value of the
  orbit to the origin is the same.  Inside=bof61 show domains where
  index(c) is constant.  That is, areas where the iteration when the orbit
  swooped closest to the origin has the same value.  Well, folks, that's
  the best we can do! Improved explanations will be accepted for the next
  edition!

  In response to this request for lucidity, Herb Savage offers this
  explanation the bof60 and bof61 options:

   The picture on page 60 of The Beauty of Fractals shows the distance to
   origin of the closest point to the origin in the sequence of points
   generated from a given X,Y coordinate.  The picture on page 61 shows
   the index (or number) in the sequence of the closest point.

  inside=zmag is similar. This option colors inside pixels according to
  the magnitude of the orbit point when maxiter was reached, using the
  formula color = (x^2 + y^2) * maxiter/2 + 1.

  inside=fmod colors inside pixels according to the magnitude of the last
  orbit point which is within a set distance from the origin.  Then:
    color = magnitude * colors / closeprox
  The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the same
  calculation as is used for the bailout test.  The value of closeprox can
  be varied interactively.  This feature was contributed by Iain Stirling.
