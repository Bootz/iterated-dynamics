 2. Fractal Types

  A list of the fractal types and their mathematics can be found in the
  Summary of Fractal Types (p. 171).  Some notes about how Fractint
  calculates them are in "A Little Code" in "Fractals and the PC" (p. 164)
  .

  Fractint starts by default with the Mandelbrot set. You can change that
  by using the command-line argument "TYPE=" followed by one of the
  fractal type names, or by using the &lt;T&gt; command and selecting the type -
  if parameters are needed, you will be prompted for them.

  In the text that follows, due to the limitations of the ASCII character
  set, "a*b" means "a times b", and "a^b" means "a to the power b".



 2.1 The Mandelbrot Set

  (type=mandel)

  This set is the classic: the only one implemented in many plotting
  programs, and the source of most of the printed fractal images published
  in recent years. Like most of the other types in Fractint, it is simply
  a graph: the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) coordinate axes represent
  ranges of two independent quantities, with various colors used to
  symbolize levels of a third quantity which depends on the first two. So
  far, so good: basic analytic geometry.

  Now things get a bit hairier. The x axis is ordinary, vanilla real
  numbers. The y axis is an imaginary number, i.e. a real number times i,
  where i is the square root of -1. Every point on the plane -- in this
  case, your PC's display screen -- represents a complex number of the
  form:

      x-coordinate + i * y-coordinate

  If your math training stopped before you got to imaginary and complex
  numbers, this is not the place to catch up. Suffice it to say that they
  are just as "real" as the numbers you count fingers with (they're used
  every day by electrical engineers) and they can undergo the same kinds
  of algebraic operations.

  OK, now pick any complex number -- any point on the complex plane -- and
  call it C, a constant. Pick another, this time one which can vary, and
  call it Z. Starting with Z=0 (i.e., at the origin, where the real and
  imaginary axes cross), calculate the value of the expression

      Z^2 + C

  Take the result, make it the new value of the variable Z, and calculate
  again. Take that result, make it Z, and do it again, and so on: in
  mathematical terms, iterate the function Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C. For
  certain values of C, the result "levels off" after a while. For all
  others, it grows without limit. The Mandelbrot set you see at the start
  -- the solid-colored lake (blue by default), the blue circles sprouting
