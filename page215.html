  Fixed bug that caused PARs to have incorrect number of parameters when a
    formula based GIF was loaded and a PAR made immediately.

  Added additional bailout tests manh and manr.  See Bailout Test (p. 98)
  .

  Fixed &lt;Z&gt; screen so bailout test can be changed when potential is being
  used.

  Fixed bug that caused large filename numbers to increment incorrectly.

  Added new guessing options g1, g2, etc. that cause guessing to terminate
    before the last pass.

  Added new orbitsave=sound option that causes orbits with sound on to
    write to a file sound.txt. The values written are the Hertz values for
    each orbit point. The time is written out in milliseconds once per
    pixel.

  Added documentation for making demm images to match ones made prior to
    version 16.

  Added key pressed check to autologmap so it is possible to bailout with
    a high maxit value.

  Made all floating point types capable of zooming out past (32,32).

  Added the formula parameters p1, p2, and p3 to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

  Added stereo pair feature to stereo options menu.

  Fixed a bug that caused julia_inverse to continue after completed.

  Bignumber library rearranged. DOS midnight bug fix, so total time of
    images run overnight is now correct.

  Added logmap backwards compatibility for pre-version 19.2 images.

  Browser problem with flipped images fixed.

  Changed default corners to 4:3 aspect for types sierpinski, popcorn,
    pickover, popcornjul, tim's_error, martin, and halley.

  Added a range check for type=ants numants parameter.

  RDS save command is no longer case sensitive.

  Added the color number to the status area in the palette editor.

  Changed logmap and distest to a long variable to accomodate the version
    19.0 change to long maxit.

  Added a pixel-at-a-time routine to calculate the logmap values on the
    fly when memory is low or maxit &gt; 32767.  Use logmode=fly to use with
    maxit &lt; 32767.  Note: ranges still doesn't work with maxit &gt; 32767.
