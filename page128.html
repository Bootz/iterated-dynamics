  RSEED=nnnn
  The initial random-number "seed" for plasma clouds is taken from your
  PC's internal clock-timer. This argument forces a value (which you can
  see in the &lt;Tab&gt; display), and allows you to reproduce plasma clouds. A
  detailed discussion of why a TRULY random number may be impossible to
  define, let alone generate, will have to wait for "FRACTINT: The 3-MB
  Doc File."

  SHOWDOT=[auto|bright|medium|dark|&lt;nnn&gt;[/&lt;size&gt;]]
  Colors the current dot being calculated color &lt;nnn&gt; or an automatically
  calculated color taken from the current palette. The second parameter is
  the size of the traveling pointer in units of pixels of 1/1024th of a
  screen.

  The travelling pointer strobes with fast fractals because of interaction
  with the monitor's vertical refresh. The orbitdelay parameter can be
  used to introduce a per-pixel delay when showdot is turned on. Try
  orbitdelay=1000 with showdot=b/20 to get a feel for how the showdot
  triangle works.

  ASPECTDRIFT=&lt;nn&gt;
  When zooming in or out, the aspect ratio (the width to height ratio) can
  change slightly due to rounding and the noncontinuous nature of pixels.
  If the aspect changes by a factor less than &lt;nn&gt;, then the aspect is set
  to it's normal value, making the center-mag Xmagfactor parameter equal
  to 1.  (see CENTER-MAG above.)  The default is 0.01.  A larger value
  adjusts more often.  A value of 0 does no adjustment at all.


 5.9 Color Parameters

  INSIDE=nnn|maxiter|bof60|bof61|zmag|epscross|startrail|period|atan|fmod
  Set the color of the interior: for example, "inside=0" makes the M-set
  "lake" a stylish basic black. A setting of inside=maxiter makes the
  inside color the same as the value of maxiter.

  Eight more options reveal hidden structure inside the lake.
  Inside=bof60 and inside=bof61, are named after the figures on pages 60
  and 61 of "Beauty of Fractals".  Inside=zmag is a method of coloring
  based on the magnitude of Z after the maximum iterations have been
  reached.  The affect along the edges of the Mandelbrot is like thin-
  metal welded sculpture.  Inside=fmod is a method of coloring based on
  the magnitude of the last orbit within a set distance from the origin.
  Inside=period colors pixels according to the period of their eventual
  orbit.  Inside=atan colors by determining the angle in degrees the last
  iterated value has with respect to the real axis, and using the absolute
  value.  See Inside=bof60|bof61|zmag|fmod|period|atan (p. 184) for a
  brilliant explanation of what these do!

  Inside=epscross colors pixels green or yellow according to whether their
  orbits swing close to the Y-axis or X-axis, respectively.
  Inside=startrail has a coloring scheme based on clusters of points in
  the orbits. Best with outside=&lt;nnn&gt;. For more information, see
  Inside=epscross|startrail (p. 185).
