  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Home&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;End&gt;
  These commands "skew" the zoom box, moving the top and bottom edges in
  opposite directions. Moving the mouse left or right while holding both
  buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse) down performs the
  same function. There are no commands to directly skew the left and right
  edges - the same effect can be achieved by using these functions
  combined with rotation.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Delete&gt;
  These commands change the zoom box color. This is useful when you're
  having trouble seeing the zoom box against the colors around it. Moving
  the mouse away from you or toward you while holding the right button
  down performs the same function.

  You may find it difficult to figure out what combination of size,
  position rotation, stretch, and skew to use to get a particular result.
  (We do.)
  A good way to get a feel for all these functions is to play with the
  Gingerbreadman fractal type. Gingerbreadman's shape makes it easy to see
  what you're doing to him. A warning though: Gingerbreadman will run
  forever, he's never quite done! So, pre-empt with your next zoom when
  he's baked enough.

  If you accidentally change your zoom box shape or rotate and forget
  which way is up, just use &lt;PageDown&gt; to make it bigger until it
  disappears, then &lt;PageUp&gt; to get a fresh one.  With a mouse, after
  removing the old zoom box from the display release and re-press the left
  button for a fresh one.

  If your screen does not have a 4:3 "aspect ratio" (i.e. if the visible
  display area on it is not 1.333 times as wide as it is high), rotating
  and zooming will have some odd effects - angles will change, including
  the zoom box's shape itself, circles (if you are so lucky as to see any
  with a non-standard aspect ratio) become non-circular, and so on. The
  vast majority of PC screens *do* have a 4:3 aspect ratio.

  Zooming is not implemented for the plasma and diffusion fractal types,
  nor for overlayed and 3D images. A few fractal types support zooming but
  do not support rotation and skewing - nothing happens when you try it.


 1.4 Color Cycling Commands

  Color-cycling mode is entered with the 'c', '+', or '-' keys from an
  image, or with the 'c' key from Palette-Editing mode.

  The color-cycling commands are available ONLY for VGA adapters and EGA
  adapters in 640x350x16 mode.  You can also enter color-cycling while
  using a disk-video mode, to load or save a palette - other functions are
  not supported in disk-video.

  Note that the colors available on an EGA adapter (16 colors at a time
  out of a palette of 64) are limited compared to those of VGA, super-VGA,
  and MCGA (16 or 256 colors at a time out of a palette of 262,144). So
  color-cycling in general looks a LOT better in the latter modes. Also,
  because of the EGA palette restrictions, some commands are not available
