 1.14 Browse Commands

  The following keystrokes function while browsing an image:

  &lt;ARROW KEYS&gt;     Step through the outlines on the screen.
  &lt;ENTER&gt;          Selects the image to display.
  &lt;\&gt;,&lt;h&gt;          Recalls the last image selected.
  &lt;D&gt;              Deletes the selected file.
  &lt;R&gt;              Renames the selected file.
  &lt;s&gt;              Saves the current image with the browser boxes
                   displayed.
  &lt;ESC&gt;,&lt;l&gt;        Toggles the browse mode off.
  &lt;Ctrl-b&gt;         Brings up the Browser Parameters (p. 149) screen.
  &lt;Ctrl-Ins/Del&gt;   Change the browser boxes color.

  This is a "visual directory", here is how it works...
  When 'L' or 'l' is pressed from a fractal display the current directory
  is searched for any saved files that are deeper zooms of the current
  image and their position shown on screen by a box (or crosshairs if the
  box would be too small). See also Browser Parameters (p. 149) for more
  on how this is done.

  One outline flashes, the selected outline can be changed by using the
  cursor keys.  At the moment the outlines are selected in the order that
  they appear in your directory, so don't worry if the flashing window
  jumps all over the place!

  When enter is pressed, the selected image is loaded. In this mode a
  stack of the last sixteen selected filenames is maintained and the '\'
  or 'h' key pops and loads the last image you were looking at.  Using
  this it is possible to set up sequences of images that allow easy
  exploration of your favorite fractal without having to wait for recalc
  once the level of zoom gets too high, great for demos! (also useful for
  keeping track of just exactly where fract532.gif came from :-) )

  You can also use this facility to tidy up your disk: by typing UPPER
  CASE 'D' when a file is selected the browser will delete the file for
  you, after making sure that you really mean it, you must reply to the
  "are you sure" prompts with an UPPER CASE 'Y' and nothing else,
  otherwise the command is ignored. Just to make absolutely sure you don't
  accidentally wipe out the fruits of many hours of cpu time the default
  setting is to have the browser prompt you twice, you can disable the
  second prompt within the parameters screen, however, if you're feeling
  overconfident :-).

  To complement the Delete function there is a rename function, use the
  UPPER CASE 'R' key for this. You need to enter the FULL new file name,
  no .GIF is implied.

  It is possible to save the current image along with all of the displayed
  boxes indicating subimages by pressing the 's' key.  This exits the
  browse mode to save the image and the boxes become a permanent part of
  the image.  Currently, the screen image ends up with stray dots colored
  after it is saved.
