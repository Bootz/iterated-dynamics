  The first parameter allows you to control the depth effect. A larger
  value (positive or negative) exaggerates the sense of depth. If you make
  the depth negative, the high and low areas of the image are reversed. If
  your RDS image is streaky try either a lower depth factor or a higher
  resolution.

  The second parameter indicates the overall width in inches of the image
  on your monitor or printout. The default value of 10 inches is roughly
  the width of an image on a standard 14" to 16" monitor. This value does
  not normally need to be changed for viewing images on standard monitors.
  However, if your monitor or image hardcopy is much wider or narrower
  than 10 inches (25 cm), and you have trouble seeing the image, enter the
  image width in inches. The issue here is that if the widest separation
  of left and right pixels is greater than the physical separation of your
  eyes, you will not be able to fuse the images. Conversely, a too-small
  separation may cause your eyes to hyper-converge (fuse the wrong pixels
  together). A larger width value reduces the width between left and right
  pixels. You can use the calibration feature to help set the width
  parameter - see below. Once you have found a good width setting, you can
  place the value in your SSTOOLS.INI file with the command
  monitorwidth=&lt;nnn&gt;.

  The third parameter allows you to control the method use to extract
  depth information from the original image. If your answer "no" at the
  "Use Grayscale value for Depth" prompt, then the color number of each
  pixel will be used.  This value is independent of active color palette.
  If you answer "yes" and the prompt, then the depth values are keyed to
  the brightness of the color, which will change if you change palettes.

  The fourth parameter allows you to set the position of vertical stereo
  calibration bars to the middle or the top of the image, or have the bars
  initially turned off. Use this feature to help you adjust your eye's
  convergence to see the image. You will see two vertical bars on the
  screen.  You can turn off and on these bars with the &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt;
  keys after generating the RDS image. If you save an RDS image by
  pressing &lt;s&gt;, if the bars are turned on at the time, they become a
  permanent part of the image.

  As you relax your eyes and look past the screen, these bars will appear
  as four bars. When you adjust your eyes so that the two middle bars
  merge into one bar, the 3D image should appear. The bars are set for the
  average depth in the area near the bars. They should always be closer
  together than the physical separation of your eyes, but not much less
  than about 1.5 inches.  About 1.75 inches is ideal for many images. The
  depth and screen width controls affect the width of the bars.

  At the RDS Parameters screen, you can select bars at the middle of the
  screen or the top. If you select "none", the bars will initially be off,
  but immediately after generation of the image you can still turn on the
  bars with &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt; before you press any other keys. If the
  initial setting of the calibration bars is "none", then if the bars are
  turned on later they will appear in the middle. Hint: if you cycle the
  colors and find you can't see the calibration bar, press &lt;Enter&gt; or
  &lt;Space&gt; twice, and the bars will turn to a more visible color.
