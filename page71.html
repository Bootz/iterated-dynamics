  The formulae are a bit more complicated than the Z^2+C used for the
  Mandelbrot Set, that's all.  They are :

                    [               ] 2
                    |  Z^2 + (C-1)  |
          MAGNET1 : | ------------- |
                    |  2*Z + (C-2)  |
                    [               ]

                    [                                         ] 2
                    |      Z^3 + 3*(C-1)*Z + (C-1)*(C-2)      |
          MAGNET2 : | --------------------------------------- |
                    |  3*(Z^2) + 3*(C-2)*Z + (C-1)*(C-2) + 1  |
                    [                                         ]

  These aren't quite as horrific as they look (oh yeah ?!) as they only
  involve two variables (Z and C), but cubing things, doing division, and
  eventually squaring the result (all in Complex Numbers) don't exactly
  spell S-p-e-e-d !  These are NOT the fastest fractals in Fractint !

  As you might expect, for both formulae there is a single related
  Mandelbrot-type set (magnet1m, magnet2m) and an infinite number of
  related Julia-type sets (magnet1j, magnet2j), with the usual toggle
  between the corresponding Ms and Js via the spacebar.

  If you fancy delving into the Julia-types by hand, you will be prompted
  for the Real and Imaginary parts of the parameter denoted by C.  The
  result is symmetrical about the Real axis (and therefore the initial
  image gets drawn in half the usual time) if you specify a value of Zero
  for the Imaginary part of C.

  Fractint Historical Note:  Another complication (besides the formulae)
  in implementing these fractal types was that they all have a finite
  attractor (1.0 + 0.0i), as well as the usual one (Infinity).  This fact
  spurred the development of Finite Attractor logic in Fractint.  Without
  this code you can still generate these fractals, but you usually end up
  with a pretty boring image that is mostly deep blue "lake", courtesy of
  Fractint's standard Periodicity Logic (p. 166).  See Finite Attractors
  (p. 185) for more information on this aspect of Fractint internals.

  (Thanks to Kevin Allen for Magnetic type documentation above).


 2.39 L-Systems

  (type=lsystem)

  These fractals are constructed from line segments using rules specified
  in drawing commands.  Starting with an initial string, the axiom,
  transformation rules are applied a specified number of times, to produce
  the final command string which is used to draw the image.

  Like the type=formula fractals, this type requires a separate data file.
  A sample file, FRACTINT.L, is included with this distribution.  When you
  select type lsystem, the current lsystem file is read and you are asked
  for the lsystem name you wish to run. Press &lt;F6&gt; at this point if you
