  Using the commands described below, you can assign particular colors to
  the registers and manipulate them.  Note that at any given time there
  are two colors "X"d - these are pre-empted by the editor to display the
  palette frame. They can be edited but the results won't be visible. You
  can change which two colors are borrowed ("X"d out) by using the &lt;v&gt;
  command.

  Once the palette frame is displayed and filled in, the following
  commands are available:

  &lt;F1&gt;
  Bring up a HELP screen with commands specific to palette-editing mode.

  &lt;Esc&gt;
  Leave palette-editing mode

  &lt;H&gt;
  Hide the palette frame to see full image; the cross-hair remains visible
  and all functions remain enabled; hit &lt;H&gt; again to restore the palette
  display.

  Cursor keys
  Move the cross-hair cursor around. In 'auto' mode (the default) the
  color under the center of the cross-hair is automatically assigned to
  the active color register. Control-Cursor keys move the cross-hair
  faster. A mouse can also be used to move around.

  &lt;R&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;B&gt;
  Select the Red, Green, or Blue component of the active color register
  for subsequent commands

  &lt;Insert&gt; &lt;Delete&gt;
  Select previous or next color component in active register

  &lt;+&gt; &lt;-&gt;
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 1  Numeric
  keypad (gray) + and - keys do the same.

  &lt;Pageup&gt; &lt;Pagedn&gt;
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 5; Moving the
  mouse up/down with left button held is the same

  &lt;0&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;2&gt; &lt;3&gt; &lt;4&gt; &lt;5&gt; &lt;6&gt;
  Set the active color component's value to 0 10 20 ... 60

  &lt;Space&gt;
  Select the other color register as the active one.  In the default
  'auto' mode this results in the now-inactive register being set to
  remember the color under the cursor, and the now-active register
  changing from whatever it had previously remembered to now follow the
  color.
