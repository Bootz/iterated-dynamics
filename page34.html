 1.11 Orbits Window

  The &lt;O&gt; key turns on the Orbit mode.  In this mode a cursor appears over
  the fractal. A window appears showing the orbit used in the calculation
  of the color at the point where the cursor is. Move the cursor around
  the fractal using the arrow keys or the mouse and watch the orbits
  change. Try entering the Orbits mode with View Windows (&lt;V&gt;) turned on.
  The following keys take effect in Orbits mode.
  &lt;c&gt;         Circle toggle - makes little circles with radii inversely
              proportional to the iteration. Press &lt;c&gt; again to toggle
              back to point-by-point display of orbits.
  &lt;l&gt;         Line toggle - connects orbits with lines (can use with &lt;c&gt;)
  &lt;n&gt;         Numbers toggle - shows complex coordinates &amp; color number of
              the cursor on the screen. Press &lt;n&gt; again to turn off numbers.
  &lt;p&gt;         Enter pixel coordinates directly
  &lt;h&gt;         Hide fractal toggle. Works only if View Windows is turned on
              and set for a small window (such as the default size.) Hides the
              fractal, allowing the orbit to take up the whole screen. Press
              &lt;h&gt; again to uncover the fractal.
  &lt;s&gt;         Saves the fractal, cursor, orbits, and numbers as they
              appear on the screen.
  &lt;&lt;&gt; or &lt;,&gt;  Zoom orbits image smaller
  &lt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;.&gt;  Zoom orbits image larger
  &lt;z&gt;         Restore default zoom.


 1.12 View Window

  The &lt;V&gt; command is used to set the view window parameters described
  below.  These parameters can be used to:
   o Define a small window on the screen which is to contain the generated
     images. Using a small window speeds up calculation time (there are
     fewer pixels to generate). You can use a small window to explore
     quickly, then turn the view window off to recalculate the image at
     full screen size.
   o Generate an image with a different "aspect ratio"; e.g. in a square
     window or in a tall skinny rectangle.
   o View saved GIF images which have pixel dimensions different from any
     mode supported by your hardware. This use of view windows occurs
     automatically when you restore such an image.
   o Define a disk video mode up to 32767x32767.  First select a disk
     video mode using &lt;del&gt;.  Then on the &lt;v&gt; screen enter both an X and a
     Y value at the Virtual Screen Total Pixels prompts.
   o Define a virtual video mode up to the size that fits in video memory.
     First select a VESA video mode (dotmode=28) using &lt;del&gt;.  Then on the
     &lt;v&gt; screen enter both an X and a Y value at the Virtual Screen Total
     Pixels prompts.  The Keep Aspect prompt is used if the asked for
     virtual screen is larger than video memory.  If set, the X and Y
     values will both be reduced such that the ratio between them is
     maintained.  If not set, just the Y value will be reduced.

  "Preview display"
  Set this to "yes" to turn on view window, "no" for full screen display.
  While this is "no", the only view parameter which has any affect is
  "final media aspect ratio". When a view window is being used, all other
  Fractint functions continue to operate normally - you can zoom, color-
