  computer screen is visited by an orbit, and whenever an orbit reaches a
  pixel that has already been visited more than a certain number of times,
  we can consider that orbit finished and move on to another one.  This
  "hit limit" thus becomes similar to the iteration limit used in the
  traditional escape-time fractal algorithm.  This is called the Modified
  Inverse Iteration Method, or MIIM, and is much faster than the IIM.

  Now, the inverse of Mandelbrot's classic function is a square root, and
  the square root actually has two solutions; one positive, one negative.
  Therefore at each step of each orbit of the inverse function there is a
  decision; whether to use the positive or the negative square root.  Each
  one gives rise to a new point on the Julia Set, so each is a good
  choice.  This series of choices defines a binary decision tree, each
  point on the Julia Set giving rise to two potential child points.  There
  are many interesting ways to traverse a binary tree, among them Breadth
  first, Depth first (left or negative first), Depth first (right or
  positive first), and completely at random.  It turns out that most
  traversal methods lead to the same or similar pictures, but that how the
  image evolves as the orbits trace it out differs wildly depending on the
  traversal method chosen.  As far as we know, this fact is an original
  discovery by Michael Snyder, and version 18.2 of FRACTINT was its first
  publication.

  Pick a Julia constant such as Z(0) = (-.74543, .11301), the popular
  Seahorse Julia, and try drawing it first Breadth first, then Depth first
  (right first), Depth first (left first), and finally with Random Walk.

  Caveats: the video memory is used in the algorithm, to keep track of how
  many times each pixel has been visited (by changing it's color).
  Therefore the algorithm will not work well if you zoom in far enough
  that part of the Julia Set is off the screen.

  Bugs:   Not working with Disk Video.
          Not resumeable.

  The &lt;J&gt; key toggles between the Inverse Julia orbit and the
  corresponding Julia escape time fractal.


 2.5 Newton domains of attraction

  (type=newtbasin)

  The Newton formula is an algorithm used to find the roots of polynomial
  equations by successive "guesses" that converge on the correct value as
  you feed the results of each approximation back into the formula. It
  works very well -- unless you are unlucky enough to pick a value that is
  on a line BETWEEN two actual roots. In that case, the sequence explodes
  into chaos, with results that diverge more and more wildly as you
  continue the iteration.

  This fractal type shows the results for the polynomial Z^n - 1, which
  has n roots in the complex plane. Use the &lt;T&gt;ype command and enter
  "newtbasin" in response to the prompt. You will be asked for a
  parameter, the "order" of the equation (an integer from 3 through 10 --
  3 for x^3-1, 7 for x^7-1, etc.). A second parameter is a flag to turn on
