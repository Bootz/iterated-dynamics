 2.35 Formula

  (type=formula)

  This is a "roll-your-own" fractal interpreter - you don't even need a
  compiler!

  To run a "type=formula" fractal, you first need a text file containing
  formulas (there's a sample file - FRACTINT.FRM - included with this
  distribution).  When you select the "formula" fractal type, Fractint
  scans the current formula file (default is FRACTINT.FRM) for formulas,
  then prompts you for the formula name you wish to run.  After prompting
  for any parameters, the formula is parsed for syntax errors and then the
  fractal is generated. If you want to use a different formula file, press
  &lt;F6&gt; when you are prompted to select a formula name.

  There are two command-line options that work with type=formula
  ("formulafile=" and "formulaname="), useful when you are using this
  fractal type in batch mode.

  The following documentation is supplied by Mark Peterson, who wrote the
  formula interpreter:

  Formula fractals allow you to create your own fractal formulas.  The
  general format is:

     Mandelbrot(XAXIS) { z = Pixel:  z = sqr(z) + pixel, |z| &lt;= 4 }
        |         |          |                |              |
       Name     Symmetry    Initial         Iteration       Bailout
                            Condition                       Criteria

  Initial conditions are set, then the iterations performed while the
  bailout criteria remains true or until 'z' turns into a periodic loop.
  All variables are created automatically by their usage and treated as
  complex.  If you declare 'v = 2' then the variable 'v' is treated as a
  complex with an imaginary value of zero.

  NOTE: For periodicity checking, inside options, outside options, and the
  passes=o option to work correctly it is necessary to leave the result of
  the orbit calculation in the variable z.

  Sequential processing of the formula can be altered with the flow
