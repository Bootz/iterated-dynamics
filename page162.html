    We've had one case where a video driver for Windows does not work
    properly with Fractint.  If running under Windows, DesqView, or some
    other layered environment, try running Fractint directly from DOS to
    see if that avoids the problem.
    We've also had one case of a problem co-existing with "386 to the
    Max".

    We've had one report of an EGA adapter which got scrambled images in
    all modes until "textsafe=no" was used (see Video Parameters (p. 134)
    ).

    Also, see Video Adapter Notes (p. 153) for information about enhanced
    video modes - Fractint makes only limited attempts to verify that a
    video mode you request is actually supported by your adapter.

  Other Hangs and Strange Behavior:
    We've had some problems (hangs and solid beeps) on an FPU equipped
    machine when running under Windows 3's enhanced mode.  The only ways
    around the problem we can find are to either run the Fractint image
    involved outside Windows, or to use the DOS command "SET NO87=nofpu"
    before running Fractint.  (This SET command makes Fractint ignore your
    fpu, so things might be a lot slower as a result.)

  Insufficient memory:
    Fractint requires a fair bit of memory to run.  Most machines with at
    least 640k (ok sticklers, make that "PC-compatible machines") will
    have no problem.  Machines with 512k and machines with many TSR
    utilities and/or a LAN interface may have problems.  Some Fractint
    features allocate memory when required during a run.  If you get a
    message about insufficient memory, or suspect that some problem is due
    to a memory shortage, you could try commenting out some TSR utilities
    in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, some non-critical drivers in your
    CONFIG.SYS file, or reducing the BUFFERS parameter in your CONFIG.SYS.

  "Cannot find FRACTINT.EXE" message:
    Fractint is an overlayed program - some parts of it are brought from
    disk into memory only when used.  The overlay manager needs to know
    where to find the program.  It must be named FRACTINT.EXE (which it is
    unless somebody renamed it), and you should either be in the directory
    containing it when you start Fractint, or that directory should be in
    your DOS PATH.

  "File FRACTINT.CFG is missing or invalid" message:
    You should either start Fractint while you are in the directory
    containing it, or should have that directory in your DOS PATH
    variable.  If that isn't the problem, maybe you have a FRACTINT.CFG
    file from an older release of Fractint lying around? If so, best
    rename or delete it.  If that isn't the problem either, then the
    FRACTINT.CFG included in the FRAINT.EXE release file has probably been
    changed or deleted. Best reinstall Fractint to get a fresh copy.

  Some other program doesn't like GIF files created by Fractint:
    Fractint generates nice clean GIF89A spec files, honest! But telling
    this to the other program isn't likely to change its mind. Instead,
    try an option which might get around the problem: run Fractint with
    the command line option "gif87a=yes" and then save an image. Fractint
