  These are the only three used when colorps=no. When color PS printing is
  being used, the other nine options specify the red, green, then blue
  screens. A negative number in any of these places will cause it to use
  the previous (or default) value for that parameter. NOTE: Especially
  when using color, the built-in screens in the printer's ROM may be the
  best choice for printing.

  The default values are as follows:
  halftone=45/45/1/45/75/1/45/15/1/45/0/1 and these will be used if
  Fractint's halftone is chosen over the printer's built-in screen.

  Current halftone styles:
      0 Dot
      1 Dot (Smoother)
      2 Dot (Inverted)
      3 Ring (Black)
      4 Ring (White)
      5 Triangle (Right)
      6 Triangle (Isosceles)
      7 Grid
      8 Diamond
      9 Line
     10 Microwaves
     11 Ellipse
     12 Rounded Box
     13 Custom
     14 Star
     15 Random
     16 Line (slightly different)

  A note on device-resolution black and white printing
  ----------------------------------------------------

  This mode of printing can now be done much more quickly, and takes a lot
  less file space. Just set EPSF=0 PRINTER=PSx/nnn COLORPS=NO RLEPS=YES
  TRANSLATE=m, where x is P or L for portrait/landscape, nnn is your
  printer's resolution, m is 2 or -2 for positive or negative printing
  respectively. This combination of parameters will print exactly one
  printer pixel per each image pixel and it will keep the proportions of
  the picture, if both your screen and printer have square pixels (or the
  same pixel-aspect). Choose a proper (read large) window size to fill as
  much of the paper as possible for the most spectacular results.  2048 by
  2048 is barely enough to fill the width of a letter size page with 300
  dpi printer resolution.  For higher resolution printers, you can use
  fractint's new larger disk video sizes, up to 32k x 32k.

  A word from the author (Scott Taylor)
  -------------------------------------

  Color PostScript printing is new to me. I don't even have a color
  printer to test it on. (Don't want money. Want a Color PostScript
  printer!) The initial tests seem to have worked. I am still testing and
  don't know whether or not some sort of gamma correction will be needed.
  I'll have to wait and see about that one.
