  ORBITINTERVAL=&lt;nn&gt;
  This parameter causes "passes=o" to plot every nth orbit point ranging
  from 1, which plots every orbit, to 255, which plots every 255th orbit.
  This value must be lower than the value of maxit to make any sense.

  SCREENCOORDS=yes|no
  This parameter maintains the screen coordinates and lets you zoom into
  an image changing the coordinates of the line or rectangle used to
  generate the image, but keeps the display coordinates the same.  The
  screen coordinates can be zoomed, rotated, and skewed using the &lt;F2&gt;
  Screen Coordinates Screen (p. 151).  If set to no, the screen and image
  coordinates are maintained the same when an image is zoomed.
  ORBITDRAWMODE=rect|line
  The rect(angle) method plots the orbits in a rectangle that can be
  zoomed, rotated, and skewed using the &lt;F6&gt; Image Coordinates Screen
  (p. 151), and the straight line method plots the orbits between two
  points specified on the &lt;F6&gt; image coordinates screen.


 5.22 Screen Coordinates Screen

  You can directly enter corner coordinates on this screen for use with
  the passes='o' option.  You can also use &lt;F4&gt; to reset the coordinates
  to the defaults for the current fractal type.

  There are two formats for the display: corners or center-mag.  You can
  toggle between the two by using &lt;F7&gt;.

  In corners mode, corner coordinate values are entered directly.  Usually
  only the top-left and bottom-right corners need be specified - the
  bottom left corner can be entered as zeros to default to an ordinary
  unrotated rectangular area.  For rotated or skewed images, the bottom
  left corner must also be specified.

  In center-mag mode the screen area is described by entering the
  coordinates for the center of the rectangle, and its magnification
  factor.  Usually only these three values are needed, but the user can
  also specify the amount that the image is stretched, rotated and skewed.


 5.23 Image Coordinates Screen

  You can directly enter corner coordinates on this screen instead of
  using the zoom box to move around.  You can also use &lt;F4&gt; to reset the
  coordinates to the defaults for the current fractal type.
