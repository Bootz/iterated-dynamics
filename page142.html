  Where:
        . = key off (silent or releasing note)
        * = note assigned a value and triggered on, attack, decay, sustain
        phase
            begins
        1 = note held on, you'll notice that above there are only ever
        four
            notes held on at any one time, though more than four may be sounding
            if there is a long release value.

  PRINTER=type[/resolution[/port#]]
  Defines your printer setup. The SSTOOLS.INI file is a REAL handy place

    EP  Epson-compatible
    HP  LaserJet
    CO  Star Micronics Color printer, supposedly Epson-color-compatible

    PS  PostScript
    PSL Postscript, landscape mode

  Resolution:
    In dots per inch.
    Epson/IBM: 60, 120, 240
    LaserJet: 75, 150, 300
    PaintJet: 90, 180
    PostScript: 10 through 600, or special value 0 to print full page to
    within about .4" of the edges (in portrait mode, width is full page and
    height is adjusted to 3:4 aspect ratio)
    Plotter: 1 to 10 for 1/Nth of page (e.g. 2 for 1/2 page)
  Port:
    1, 2, 3 for LPT1-3 via BIOS
    11, 12, 13, 14 for COM1-4 via BIOS
    21, 22 for LPT1 or LPT2 using direct port access (faster when it works)

  COMPORT=port/baud/options
  Serial printer port initialization.
  Port=1,2,3,etc.
