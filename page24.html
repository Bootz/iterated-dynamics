  Color cycling applies to the color numbers selected by the "cyclerange="
  command line parameter (also changeable via the &lt;Y&gt; options screen and
  via the palette editor).  By default, color numbers 1 to 255 inclusive
  are cycled.  On some images you might want to set "inside=0" (&lt;X&gt;
  options or command line parameter) to exclude the "lake" from color
  cycling.

  When you are in color-cycling mode, you will either see the screen
  colors cycling, or will see a white "overscan" border when paused, as a
  reminder that you are still in this mode.  The keyboard commands
  available once you've entered color-cycling. are described below.

  &lt;F1&gt;
  Bring up a HELP screen with commands specific to color cycling mode.

  &lt;Esc&gt;
  Leave color-cycling mode.

  &lt;Home&gt;
  Restore original palette.

  &lt;+&gt; or &lt;-&gt;
  Begin cycling the palette by shifting each color to the next "contour."
  &lt;+&gt; cycles the colors in one direction, &lt;-&gt; in the other.

  '&lt;' or '&gt;'
  Force a color-cycling pause, disable random colorizing, and single-step
  through a one color-cycle.  For "fine-tuning" your image colors.

  Cursor up/down
  Increase/decrease the cycling speed. High speeds may cause a harmless
  flicker at the top of the screen.

  &lt;F2&gt; through &lt;F10&gt;
  Switches from simple rotation to color selection using randomly
  generated color bands of short (F2) to long (F10) duration.

  &lt;1&gt; through &lt;9&gt;
  Causes the screen to be updated every 'n' color cycles (the default is
  1).  Handy for slower computers.

  &lt;Enter&gt;
  Randomly selects a function key (F2 through F10) and then updates ALL
  the screen colors prior to displaying them for instant, random colors.
  Hit this over and over again (we do).

  &lt;Spacebar&gt;
  Pause cycling with white overscan area. Cycling restarts with any
  command key (including another spacebar).

  &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;F1&gt;-&lt;F10&gt;
  Pause cycling and reset the palette to a preset two color "straight"
  assignment, such as a spread from black to white. (Not for EGA)
