 2.10 Circle

  (type=circle)

  This fractal types is from A. K. Dewdney's "Computer Recreations" column
  in "Scientific American". It is attributed to John Connett of the
  University of Minnesota.

  (Don't tell anyone, but this fractal type is not really a fractal!)

  Fascinating Moire patterns can be formed by calculating x^2 + y^2 for
  each pixel in a piece of the complex plane. After multiplication by a
  magnification factor (the parameter), the number is truncated to an
  integer and mapped to a color via color = value modulo (number of
  colors). That is, the integer is divided by the number of colors, and
  the remainder is the color index value used.  The resulting image is not
  a fractal because all detail is lost after zooming in too far. Try it
  with different resolution video modes - the results may surprise you!

  If inside=startrail is used, it will automatically be set to inside=norm
  by Fractint.  This is because type circle and inside=startrail locks up
  Fractint.


 2.11 Plasma Clouds

  (type=plasma)

  Plasma clouds ARE real live fractals, even though we didn't know it at
  first. They are generated by a recursive algorithm that randomly picks
  colors of the corner of a rectangle, and then continues recursively
  quartering previous rectangles. Random colors are averaged with those of
  the outer rectangles so that small neighborhoods do not show much
  change, for a smoothed-out, cloud-like effect. The more colors your
  video mode supports, the better.  The result, believe it or not, is a
  fractal landscape viewed as a contour map, with colors indicating
  constant elevation.  To see this, save and view with the &lt;3&gt; command
  (see "3D" Images (p. 106)) and your "cloud" will be converted to a
  mountain!

  You've GOT to try color cycling (p. 23) on these (hit "+" or "-").  If
  you haven't been hypnotized by the drawing process, the writhing colors
  will do it for sure. We have now implemented subliminal messages to
  exploit the user's vulnerable state; their content varies with your bank
  balance, politics, gender, accessibility to a Fractint programmer, and
  so on. A free copy of Microsoft C to the first person who spots them.

  This type accepts four parameters.

  The first determines how abruptly the colors change. A value of .5
  yields bland clouds, while 50 yields very grainy ones. The default value
  is 2.

  The second determines whether to use the original algorithm (0) or a
  modified one (1). The new one gives the same type of images but draws
  the dots in a different order. It will let you see what the final image
