  south west of Britain sorting out peoples IT problems. Anyone wishing to
  offer him interesting work in anything to do with computers can find a
  CV at: http://web.ukonline.co.uk/robin.b2/rbcv.htm

  When not playing with computers Robin likes to relax by experimenting
  with kite powered traction and can often be found hurtling around the
  local beaches on the end of a few square metres of fabric and carbon
  fibre in various configurations.

  DISTRIBUTION OF FRACTINT

  New versions of FRACTINT are uploaded to the Fractint developer's web
  site at www.fractint.org, and make their way to other systems from that
  point.  FRACTINT is available as two self-extracting archive files -
  FRAINT.EXE (executable &amp; documentation) and FRASRC.EXE (source code).

  The latest developer's version can also be found at www.fractint.org.

  Many other sites tend to carry these files shortly after their initial
  release (although sometimes using different naming conventions).  Look
  for frainnn.zip (executable package) and frasrnnn.zip (source), where
  nnn is the release number. Major releases with two digit numbers have
  names such as fraintnn.zip and frasrcnn.zip.

  On the Internet, try the Noel Giffin's Spanky Fractal Database. Using a
  Web browser, go to:
  http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/ibmpc/frainxxx.zip
  where xxx is the release number.

  Via FTP, login to spanky.triumf.ca as ANONYMOUS, and change directories
  to [pub.fractals.programs.ibmpc], then download frainxxx.zip. (The
  directory syntax is in VAX format.)

  The X Windows port of Fractint was written by Ken Shirriff and is
  available via FTP from
  http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/unix/XFRACTxxx.zip
  where xxx is the Xfractint release number.  Developer's versions of
  Xfractint are available at the Fractint developer's web site.

  CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
  Communication between the authors for development of the next version of
  Fractint takes place in the fractint mailing list.



  The following authors have agreed to the distribution of their
  addresses.  Usenet/Internet/Bitnet/Whatevernet users can reach CIS users
  directly if they know the user ID.

  Postal addresses are listed below so that you have a way to send bug
  reports and ideas to the Stone Soup team.

  Please understand that we receive a lot of mail, and because of the
  demands of volunteer work on Fractint as well as our professional
  responsibilities, we are generally unable to answer it all.  Several of
  us have reached the point where we can't answer any conventional mail.
