  will look like much sooner than the old one.

  The third determines whether to use a new seed for generating the next
  plasma cloud (0) or to use the previous seed (1).

  The fourth parameter turns on 16-bit .POT output which provides much
  smoother height gradations. This is especially useful for creating
  mountain landscapes when using the plasma output with a ray tracer such
  as POV-Ray.

  With parameter three set to 1, the next plasma cloud generated will be
  identical to the previous but at whatever new resolution is desired.

  Zooming is ignored, as each plasma-cloud screen is generated randomly.

  The random number seed used for each plasma image is displayed on the
  &lt;tab&gt; information screen, and can be entered with the command line
  parameter "rseed=" to recreate a particular image.

  The algorithm is based on the Pascal program distributed by Bret Mulvey
  as PLASMA.ARC. We have ported it to C and integrated it with Fractint's
  graphics and animation facilities. This implementation does not use
  floating-point math. The algorithm was modified starting with version 18
  so that the plasma effect is independent of screen resolution.

  Saved plasma-cloud screens are EXCELLENT starting images for fractal
  "landscapes" created with the "3D" commands (p. 32).


 2.12 Lambdafn

  (type=lambdafn)

  Function=[sin|cos|sinh|cosh|exp|log|sqr|...]) is specified with this
  type.  Prior to version 14, these types were lambdasine, lambdacos,
  lambdasinh, lambdacos, and lambdaexp.  Where we say "lambdasine" or some
  such below, the good reader knows we mean "lambdafn with function=sin".)

  These types calculate the Julia set of the formula lambda*fn(Z), for
  various values of the function "fn", where lambda and Z are both
  complex.  Two values, the real and imaginary parts of lambda, should be
  given in the "params=" option.  For the feathery, nested spirals of
  LambdaSines and the frost-on-glass patterns of LambdaCosines, make the
  real part = 1, and try values for the imaginary part ranging from 0.1 to
  0.4 (hint: values near 0.4 have the best patterns). In these ranges the
  Julia set "explodes". For the tongues and blobs of LambdaExponents, try
  a real part of 0.379 and an imaginary part of 0.479.

  A coprocessor used to be almost mandatory: each LambdaSine/Cosine
  iteration calculates a hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, a sine, and a
  cosine (the LambdaExponent iteration "only" requires an exponent, sine,
  and cosine operation)!  However, Fractint now computes these
  transcendental functions with fast integer math. In a few cases the fast
  math is less accurate, so we have kept the old slow floating point code.
  To use the old code, invoke with the float=yes option, and, if you DON'T
  have a coprocessor, go on a LONG vacation!
