  The fifth parameter asks if you want to use an image map GIF file
  instead of using random dots. An image map can give your RDS image a
  more interesting background texture than the random dots. If you answer
  "yes" at the Use image map? prompt, Fractint will present you with a
  file selection list of GIF images. Fractint will then go ahead and
  transform your original image to RDS using the selected image map to
  provide the "random" dots.

  After you have selected an image map file, the next time you reach the
  RDS Parameters screen you will see an additional prompt asking if you
  want to use the same image map file again. Answering "yes" avoids the
  file selection menu.

  The best images to use as image maps are detailed textures with no solid
  spots. The default type=circle fractal works well, as do the barnsley
  fractals if you zoom in a little way. If the image map is smaller than
  your RDS image, the image map will repeated to fill the space. If the
  image map is larger, just the upper left corner of the image map will be
  used.

  The original image you are using for your stereogram is saved, so if you
  want to modify the stereogram parameters and try again, just press
  &lt;ctrl-s&gt; (or &lt;k&gt;) to get the parameter screen, changes the parameters,
  and press &lt;Enter&gt;. The original image is restored and an RDS transform
  with the revised parameters is performed. If you press &lt;s&gt; when viewing
  an RDS image, after the RDS image is saved, the original is restored.

  Try the RDS feature with continuous potential Mandelbrots as well as
  plasma fractals.

 3.14 Freestyle mode tutorial

  It can be confusing working out what's going on in freestyle mode so
  here's a quick walk through...

  Freestyle palette editing is intended to be a way of colouring an image
  in an intuitive fashion with the minimum of keyboard usage. In fact
  everything is controllable with the mouse, as the following shows:

  To start with, generate a plasma type fractal as it has all 256 colours
  on screen at once. Now bring up the palette editor and press 'w' to set
  up a greyscale palette as a blank canvas on which to splash some colour.
  Pressing 'f' puts us in freestyle mode... crosshairs appear on the
  screen and a colour band is applied, centred on the cursor. Although, at
  the moment, the colour of this band is grey and you won't see much!

  In order to change the colour of the band, hold down the left mouse
  button and drag up and down.  This changes the amount of red in the
  band. You'll see the values change in the status box above the palette
  grid. Double clicking the right mouse button changes the colour
  component that's varied in an r-g-b-r-cycle.... try it out and conjure
  up any shade you like!
