      the new MAGNETic Fractal types.
    Added Finite Attractor Bailout (FAB) logic to detect when iterations
      are approaching a known finite attractor. This is required by the
      new MAGNETic Fractal types.
    Added Finite Attractor Detection (FAD) logic which can be used by
      *SOME* Julia types prior to generating an image, to test for finite
      attractors, and find their values, for use by FAB logic. Can be used
      by the new MAGNETic Fractal Types, Lambda Sets, and some other Julia
      types too.

    Mike Burkey sent us new tweaked video modes:
      VGA     - 400x600x256   376x564x256   400x564x256
      ATI VGA - 832x612x256 New HP Paintjet support from Chris Martin
    New "FUNCTION=" command to allow substition of different
      transcendental functions for variables in types (allows one type
      with four of these variables to represent 7*7*7*7 different types!
    ALL KINDS of new fractal types, some using "FUNCTION=": fn(z*z),
      fn*fn, fn*z+z, fn+fn, sqr(1/fn), sqr(fn), spider, tetrate, and
      Manowar. Most of these are generalizations of formula fractal types
      contributed by Scott Taylor and Lee Skinner.
    Distance Estimator logic can now be applied to many fractal types
      using distest= option. The types "demm" and "demj" have been
      replaced by "type=mandel distest=nnn" and "type=julia distest=nnn"
    Added extended memory support for diskvideo thanks to Paul Varner
    Added support for "center and magnification" format for corners.
    Color 0 is no longer generated except when specifically requested with
      inside= or outside=.
    Formula name is now included in &lt;Tab&gt; display and in &lt;S&gt;aved images.
    Bug fixes - formula type and diskvideo, batch file outside=-1 problem.
    Now you can produce your favorite fractal terrains in full color
      instead of boring old monochrome! Use the fullcolor option in 3d!
      Along with a few new 3D options.
    New "INITORBIT=" command to allow alternate Mandelbrot set orbit
      initialization.


  Version 13.0, 5/90

    F1 was made the help key.
      Use F1 for help
      Use F9 for EGA 320x200x16 video mode
      Use CF4 for EGA 640x200x16 mode (if anybody uses that mode)
    Super-Solid-guessing (three or more passes) from Pieter Branderhorst
      (replaces the old solid-guessing mode)
    Boundary Tracing option from David Guenther ("fractint passes=btm", or
      use the new 'x' options screen)
    "outside=nnn" option sets all points not "inside" the fractal to color
      "nnn" (and generates a two-color image).
    'x' option from the main menu brings up a full-screen menu of many
      popular options and toggle switches
    "Speed Key" feature for fractal type selection (either use the cursor
      keys for point-and-shoot, or just start typing the name of your
      favorite fractal type)
    "Attractor" fractals (Henon, Rossler, Pickover, Gingerbread)
    Diffusion fractal type by Adrian Mariano
    "type=formula" formulas from Scott Taylor and Lee H. Skinner.
