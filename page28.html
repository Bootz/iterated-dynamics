  Pause and load an external color map (.MAP file).  See Palette Maps
  (p. 88).

  &lt;S&gt;
  Pause, prompt for a filename, and save the current palette to the named
  file (.MAP assumed).  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  &lt;I&gt;
  Invert frame colors.  With some colors the palette is easier to see when
  the frame colors are interchanged.

  &lt;\&gt;
  Move or resize the palette frame.  The frame outline is drawn - it can
  then be repositioned and sized with the cursor keys, &lt;Pageup&gt; and
  &lt;Pagedn&gt;, just as was done when first entering palette-editing mode.
  Hit Enter when done moving/sizing.

  &lt;V&gt;
  Use the colors currently selected by the two color registers for the
  palette editor's frame.  When palette editing mode is entered, the last
  two colors are "X"d out for use by the palette editor; this command can
  be used to replace the default with two other color numbers.

  &lt;A&gt;
  Toggle 'auto' mode on or off.  When on (the default), the active color
  register follows the cursor; when off, &lt;Enter&gt; must be pressed to set
  the active register to the color under the cursor.

  &lt;Enter&gt;
  Only useful when 'auto' is off, as described above; double clicking the
  left mouse button is the same as Enter.

  &lt;X&gt;
  Toggle 'exclude' mode on or off - when toggled on, only those image
  pixels which match the active color are displayed.

  &lt;Y&gt;
  Toggle 'exclude' range on or off - similar to &lt;X&gt;, but all pixels
  matching colors in the range of the two color registers are displayed.

  &lt;N&gt;
  Make a negative color palette - will convert only current color if in
  'x' mode or range between editors in 'y' mode or entire palette if in
  "normal" mode.

  &lt;!&gt;
  &lt;@&gt;     &lt;"&gt;       (English keyboard)  &lt;u-grave&gt; (French keyboard)
  &lt;#&gt;  &lt;pound sign&gt; (English keyboard)     &lt;$&gt;    (French keyboard)
  Swap R&lt;-&gt;G, G&lt;-&gt;B, and R&lt;-&gt;B columns. &lt;!&gt;, &lt;@&gt;, and &lt;#&gt; are shifted 1,
  2, and 3, which you may find easier to remember.

  &lt;U&gt;
  Undoes the last palette editor command.  Will undo all the way to the
  beginning of the current session.
