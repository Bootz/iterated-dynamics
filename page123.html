  WORKDIR=[directory]
  This command sets the directory where miscellaneous Fractint files get
  written, including MAKEMIG.BAT and debugging files.

  FILENAME=[name]
  Causes Fractint to read the named file, which must either have been
  saved from an earlier Fractint session or be a generic GIF file, and use
  that as the starting point, bypassing the initial information screens.
  The filetype is optional and defaults to .GIF. Non-Fractint GIF files
  are restored as fractal type "plasma".

  On the DOS command line you may omit FILENAME= and just give the file
  name.

  CURDIR=yes
  Fractint uses directories set by various commands, possibly in the
  SSTOOLS.INI file. If you want to try out some files in the current
  directory, such as a modified copy of FRACTINT.FRM, you won't Fractint
  to read the copy in your official FRM directory. Setting curdir=yes at
  the command line will cause Fractint to look in the current directory
  for requested files first before looking in the default directory set by
  the other commands. Warning: &lt;tab&gt; screen may not reflect actual file
  opened in cases where the file was opened in the DOS current directory.

  MAKEPAR=parfile/entryname
  This command invokes a batch facility to copy fractal and color
  information stored in GIF files to PAR format. The syntax is:
       fractint filename.gif makepar=parfile.par/entryname &gt;&gt; makepar.log
  The entryname is optional and defaults to the name of the gif filename
  if absent. Other parameters can appear before the makepar= command, but
  anything after will ignored. If the parfile and entryname exist, the
  entry will replace the previous entry. If the entry doesn't exist, it
  will be added. If the parfile doesn't exist it will be created.
  Redirection of output to a log file is possible in the DOS version
  because all screen output is written to the standard output.

  If you leave the GIF filename out of the command lime but add a map=
  command, then the makepar command will write a PAR named for the color
  map with only the colors in the PAR entry. This is a handy tool for
  converting maps into compressed PAR colors entry. For example, you could
  type:
       fractint map=lyapunov.map makepar=mycolors &gt;&gt; makepar.log
  This adds a colors-only PAR entry called lyapunov.map to mycolors.par.

  MAXLINELENGTH=nnn
  This command sets the maximum width of lines in a PAR entry.

  COMMENT=[comment1]/[comment2]/[comment3]/[comment4]
  Inserts comments into PAR files. These comments can include variables
  that are expanded at the time the PAR file is created. Variables are
  indicated by $varname$. Underscore characters are expanded to blanks.
  If you want to include the special characters '$', '_', or '\' in a
  comment, precede the character with '\'. Supported variables are:
