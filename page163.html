    will store the image in the older GIF87A format, without any fractal
    parameters in it (so you won't be able to load the image back into
    Fractint and zoom into it - the fractal type, coordinates, etc. are
    not stored in this older format), and without an "aspect ratio" in the
    GIF header (we've seen one utility which doesn't like that field.)

  Disk video mode performance:
    This won't be blindingly fast at the best of times, but there are
    things which can slow it down and can be tuned.  See "Disk-Video"
    Modes (p. 156) for details.

  Sound card output isn't working:
    If you get the message "FM hardware not present" when trying to switch
    on output from your sound card then check that the drivers you
    installed with the card have set the BLASTER environment variable. To
    do this go to a DOS prompt and type SET, this command will list a
    bunch of lines like this:
    VARIABLE=VALUE
    ANOTHERVARIABLE=ANOTHER VALUE

    one of these should look like:
    BLASTER=A:220 I:5 D:3
    or similar, it's the A: entry that's important. If you don't have the
    variable set then try putting the line:
    SET BLASTER=A:220
    in your autoexec.bat file, though be warned that if your sound
    hardware isn't compatable or has its base i/o address set differently
    to the 220H, then unexpected things may happen as fractint tries to
    write to hardware that isn't there.

    If you get no warning message but still can't hear anything then try
    to alter the volume of your card's output using whatever utility came
    with the card. For windows 95 doubleclick on the small loudspeaker
    icon on your task bar and play with the sliders, you may have to go to
    the mixer properties menu and enable the control for the FM output to
    appear, this may be called 'synthesizer', 'FM', 'midi', or 'legacy'
    depending on your hardware.  Also fractint is unlikely to be able to
    continue sounding notes when running in the background under windows
    95, so you'll need to keep switching back and forth until things are
    set right.
