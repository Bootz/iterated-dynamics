     algorithm, because some of these parameters are used in the Julibrot
     layering process.

     From/To Parameters These parameters allow you to specify the
     "Mandelbrot" values used to generate the layered Julias. The
     parameter c in the Julia formulas will be incremented in steps
     ranging from the "from" x and y values to the "to" x and y values. If
     the orbit formula is one of the "true" four dimensional fractal types
     quat, quatj, hypercomplex, or hypercomplexj, then these numbers are
     used with the 3rd and 4th dimensional values.

     The "from/to" variables are different for the different kinds of
     orbit algorithm.

        2D Julia sets - complex number formula z' = f(z) + c
           The "from/to" parameters change the values of c.
        4D Julia sets - Quaternion or Hypercomplex formula z' = f(z) + c
           The four dimensions of c are set by the orbit parameters.
           The first two dimensions of z are determined by the corners values.
           The third and fourth dimensions of z are the "to/from" variables.
        4D Mandelbrot sets - Quaternion or Hypercomplex formula z' = f(z) + c
           The first two dimensions of c are determined by the corners values.
           The third and fourth dimensions of c are the "to/from" variables.

  Distance between the eyes - set this to 2.5 if you want a red/blue
     anaglyph image, 0 for a normal greyscale image.

  Number of z pixels - this sets how many layers are rendered in the
     screen z-axis. Use a higher value with higher resolution video modes.

  The remainder of the parameters are needed to construct the red/blue
  picture so that the fractal appears with the desired depth and proper
  'z' location.  With the origin set to 8 inches beyond the screen plane
  and the depth of the fractal at 8 inches the default fractal will appear
  to start at 4 inches beyond the screen and extend to 12 inches if your
  eyeballs are 2.5 inches apart and located at a distance of 24 inches
  from the screen.  The screen dimensions provide the reference frame.


 2.37 Diffusion Limited Aggregation

  (type=diffusion)

  Standard diffusion begins with a single point in the center of the
  screen.  Subsequent points move around randomly until coming into
  contact with a point already on the screen, at which time their
  locations are fixed and they are drawn.  This process repeats until the
  fractals reaches the edge of the screen.  Use the show orbits function
  to see the points' random motion.

  One unfortunate problem is that on a large screen, this process will
  tend to take eons.  To speed things up, the points are restricted to a
  box around the initial point.  The first parameter to diffusion contains
  the size of the border between the fractal and the edge of the box.  If
  you make this number small, the fractal will look more solid and will be
  generated more quickly.
