  setting, the fractal type, and your choice of drawing mode.  Solid-
  guessing (the default) is fastest, but it can be wrong: perfectionists
  will want to use dual-pass mode (its first-pass preview is handy if you
  might zoom pre-emptively) or single-pass mode.

  When you start systematically exploring, you can save time (and hey,
  every little bit helps -- these "objects" are INFINITE, remember!) by
  &lt;S&gt;aving your last screen in a session to a file, and then going
  straight to it the next time by using the command FRACTINT FRACTxxx (the
  .GIF extension is assumed), or by starting Fractint normally and then
  using the &lt;R&gt; command to reload the saved file. Or you could hit &lt;B&gt; to
  create a parameter file entry with the "recipe" for a given image, and
  next time use the &lt;@&gt; command to re-plot it.


 1.18 Fractint on Unix

  Fractint has been ported to Unix to run under X Windows.  This version
  is called "Xfractint".  Xfractint may be obtained by anonymous ftp, see
  Distribution of Fractint (p. 195).

  Xfractint is still under development and is not as reliable as the IBM
  PC version.

  Contact xfractint@fractint.org for more information on Xfractint.
