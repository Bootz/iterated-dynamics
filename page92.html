  Enabling the distance estimator method automatically toggles to floating
  point mode. When you reset distest back to zero, remember to also turn
  off floating point mode if you want it off.

  Unfortunately, images using the distance estimator method can take many
  hours to calculate even on a fast machine with a coprocessor, especially
  if a high "maxiter" value is used.  One way of dealing with this is to
  leave it turned off while you find and frame an image.  Then hit &lt;B&gt; to
  save the current image information in a parameter file (see Parameter
  Save/Restore Commands (p. 30)).  Use an editor to change the parameter
  file entry, adding "distest=1", "video=something" to select a high-
  resolution monochrome disk-video mode, "maxiter=1000", and "inside=0".
  Run the parameter file entry with the &lt;@&gt; command when you won't be
  needing your machine for a while (over the weekend?)

  To reproduce images made prior to version 16.0, it is necessary to set
  several parameters from the command line or using &lt;G&gt;.  First, set
  "release=1510", then set "olddemmcolors=y".  To obtain the fine strands
  it is necessary to set the "width factor" to a large negative value,
  such as -32000.


 3.5 Inversion

  Many years ago there was a brief craze for "anamorphic art": images
  painted and viewed with the use of a cylindrical mirror, so that  they
  looked weirdly distorted on the canvas but correct in the distorted
  reflection. (This byway of art history may be a useful defense when your
  friends and family give you odd looks for staring at fractal images
  color-cycling on a CRT.)

  The Inversion option performs a related transformation on most of the
  fractal types. You define the center point and radius of a circle;
  Fractint maps each point inside the circle to a corresponding point
  outside, and vice-versa. This is known to mathematicians as inverting
  (or if you want to get precise, "everting") the plane, and is something
  they can contemplate without getting a headache. John Milnor (also
  mentioned in connection with the Distance Estimator Method (p. 91)),
  made his name in the 1950s with a method for everting a seven-
  dimensional sphere, so we have a lot of catching up to do.

  For example, if a point inside the circle is 1/3 of the way from the
  center to the radius, it is mapped to a point along the same radial
  line, but at a distance of (3 * radius) from the origin. An outside
  point at 4 times the radius is mapped inside at 1/4 the radius.

  The inversion parameters on the &lt;Y&gt; options screen allow entry of the
  radius and center coordinates of the inversion circle. A default choice
  of -1 sets the radius at 1/6 the smaller dimension of the image
  currently on the screen.  The default values for Xcenter and Ycenter use
  the coordinates currently mapped to the center of the screen.

  Try this one out with a Newton (p. 48) plot, so its radial "spokes"
  will give you something to hang on to. Plot a Newton-method image, then
  set the inversion radius to 1, with default center coordinates. The
  center "explodes" to the periphery.
