    "sound=" options for attractor fractals.  Sound=x  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'x' attractor value  Sound=y  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'y' attractor value.  Sound=z  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'z' attractor value  (These options are best
      invoked with the floating-point algorithm flag set.)
    "hertz=" option for adjusting the "sound=x/y/z" output.
    Printer support for color printers (printer=color) from Kurt Sowa
    Trident 4000 and Oak Technologies SuperVGA support from John Bridges
    Improved 8514/A support (the zoom-box keeps up with the cursor keys
    now!)
    Tandy 1000 640x200x16 mode from Brian Corbino (which does not, as yet,
      work with the F1(help) and TAB functions)
    The Julibrot fractal type and the Starmap option now automatically
      verify that they have been selected with a 256-color palette, and
      search for, and use, the appropriate GLASSESn.MAP or ALTERN.MAP
      palette map when invoked.  *You* were supposed to be doing that
      manually all along, but *you* probably never read the docs, huh?
    Bug Fixes:
      TAB key now works after R(estore) commands
      PS/2 Model 30 (MCGA) adapters should be able to select 320x200x256
        mode again (we think)
      Everex video adapters should work with the Autodetect modes again
        (we think)


  Version 12.0, 3/90

    New SuperVGA Autodetecting and VESA Video modes (you tell us the
      resolution you want, and we'll figure out how to do it)
    New Full-Screen Entry for most prompting
    New Fractal formula interpreter ('type=formula') - roll your own
      fractals without using a "C" compiler!
    New 'Julibrot' fractal type
    Added floating point option to all remaining fractal types.
    Real (funny glasses) 3D - Now with "real-time" lorenz3D!!
    Non-Destructive &lt;TAB&gt; - Check out what your fractal parameters are
      without stopping the generation of a fractal image
    New Cross-Hair mode for changing individual palette colors (VGA only)
    Zooming beyond the limits of Integer algorithms (with automatic
      switchover to a floating-point algorithm when you zoom in "too far")
    New 'inside=bof60', 'inside=bof61' ("Beauty of Fractals, Page nn")
    options
    New starmap ('a' - for astrology? astronomy?) transformation option
    Restrictions on the options available when using Expanded Memory
      "Disk/RAM" video mode have been removed
    And a lot of other nice little clean-up features that we've already
      forgotten that we've added...
    Added capability to create 3D projection images (just barely) for
      people with 2 or 4 color video boards.

  Version 11.0, 1/90

    More fractal types
      mandelsinh/lambdasinh        mandelcosh/lambdacosh
      mansinzsqrd/julsinzsqrd      mansinexp/julsinexp
      manzzprw/julzzpwr            manzpower/julzpower
