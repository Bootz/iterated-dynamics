  VESADETECT=yes|no
  Specify no to bypass VESA video detection logic. Try this if you
  encounter video problems with a VESA compliant video adapter or driver.

  AFI=yes|8514|no
  Normally, when you attempt to use an 8514/A-specific video mode,
  Fractint first attempts to detect the presence of an 8514/A register-
  compatible adapter.  If it fails to find one, it then attempts to detect
  the presence of an 8514/A-compatible API (IE, IBM's HDILOAD or its
  equivalent).  Fractint then uses either its register-compatible or its
  API-compatible video logic based on the results of those tests.  If you
  have an "8514/A-compatible" video adapter that passes Fractint's
  register-compatible detection logic but doesn't work correctly with
  Fractint's register-compatible video logic, setting "afi=yes" will force
  Fractint to bypass the register-compatible code and look only for the
  API interface.

  TEXTSAFE=yes|no|bios|save
  When you switch from a graphics image to text mode (e.g. when you use
  &lt;F1&gt; while a fractal is on display), Fractint remembers the graphics
  image, and restores it when you return from the text mode.  This should
  be no big deal - there are a number of well-defined ways Fractint could
  do this which *should* work on any video adapter.  They don't - every
  fast approach we've tried runs into a bug on one video adapter or
  another.  So, we've implemented a fast way which works on most adapters
  in most modes as the default, and added this parameter for use when the
  default approach doesn't work.
  If you experience the following problems, please fool around with this
  parameter to try to fix the problem:
    o Garbled image, or lines or dashes on image, when returning to image
      after going to menu, &lt;tab&gt; display, or help.
    o Blank screen when starting Fractint.
  The problems most often occur in higher resolution modes. We have not
  encountered them at all in modes under 320x200x256 - for those modes
  Fractint always uses a fast image save/restore approach.
  Textsafe options:
    yes: This is the default. When switching to/from graphics, Fractint
      saves just that part of video memory which EGA/VGA adapters are
      supposed to modify during the mode changes.
    no: This forces use of monochrome 640x200x2 mode for text displays
      (when there is a high resolution graphics image to be saved.) This
      choice is fast but uses chunky and colorless characters. If it turns
      out to be the best choice for you, you might want to also specify
      "textcolors=mono" for a more consistent appearance in text screens.
    bios: This saves memory in the same way as textsafe=yes, but uses the
      adapter's BIOS routines to save/restore the graphics state.  This
      approach is fast and ought to work on all adapters. Sadly, we've
      found that very few adapters implement this function perfectly.
    save: It should work on all adapters in all modes but it can be slow.
      It tells Fractint to save/restore the entire image. Expanded or
      extended memory is used for the save if you have enough available;
      otherwise a temporary disk file is used. The speed of textsafe=save
      will be acceptable on some machines but not others.  If this method
      is too slow, try the other textsafe modes.  The speed depends on:
        o Cpu and video adapter speed.
        o Whether enough expanded or extended memory is available.
