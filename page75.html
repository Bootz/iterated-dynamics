  The julia(fn||fn) type calculates the Julia set of the formula fn(Z)+C,
  for various values of the function "fn", where C and Z are both complex.
  Two values, the real and imaginary parts of C, should be given in the
  "params=" option.  The third value is the shift value.  The space bar
  will generate the corresponding mandelbrot set, mandel(fn||fn).

 2.42 Halley

  (type=halley)

  The Halley map is an algorithm used to find the roots of polynomial
  equations by successive "guesses" that converge on the correct value as
  you feed the results of each approximation back into the formula. It
  works very well -- unless you are unlucky enough to pick a value that is
  on a line BETWEEN two actual roots. In that case, the sequence explodes
  into chaos, with results that diverge more and more wildly as you
  continue the iteration.

  This fractal type shows the results for the polynomial Z(Z^a - 1), which
  has a+1 roots in the complex plane. Use the &lt;T&gt;ype command and enter
  "halley" in response to the prompt. You will be asked for a parameter,
  the "order" of the equation (an integer from 2 through 10 -- 2 for Z(Z^2
  - 1), 7 for Z(Z^7 - 1), etc.). A second parameter is the relaxation
  coefficient, and is used to control the convergence stability. A number
  greater than one increases the chaotic behavior and a number less than
  one decreases the chaotic behavior. The third parameter is the value
  used to determine when the formula has converged. The test for
  convergence is ||Z(n+1)|^2 - |Z(n)|^2| &lt; epsilon. This convergence test
  produces the whisker-like projections which generally point to a root.


 2.43 Dynamic System

  (type=dynamic, dynamic2)

  These fractals are based on a cyclic system of differential equations:
           x'(t) = -f(y(t))
           y'(t) = f(x(t))
  These equations are approximated by using a small time step dt, forming
  a time-discrete dynamic system:
           x(n+1) = x(n) - dt*f(y(n))
           y(n+1) = y(n) + dt*f(x(n))
  The initial values x(0) and y(0) are set to various points in the plane,
  the dynamic system is iterated, and the resulting orbit points are
  plotted.

  In fractint, the function f is restricted to: f(k) = sin(k + a*fn1(b*k))
  The parameters are the spacing of the initial points, the time step dt,
  and the parameters (a,b,fn1) that affect the function f.  Normally the
