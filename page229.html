    New color-cycling single-step options, '&lt;' and '&gt;'.

  Version 16.0, 6/91

    Integrated online help / fractint.doc system from Ethan Nagel.  To
      create a printable fractint.doc file see Startup Parameters (p. 122)
      .

    Over 350 screens of online help! Try pressing &lt;F1&gt; just about
    anywhere!

    New "autokey" feature.  Type "demo" to run the included demo.bat and
      demo.key files for a great demonstration of Fractint.  See Autokey
      Mode (p. 89) for details.

    New &lt;@&gt; command executes a saved set of commands.  The &lt;b&gt; command has
      changed to write the current image's parameters as a named set of
      commands in a structured file.  Saved sets of commands can
      subsequently be executed with the &lt;@&gt; command.  See Parameter
      Save/Restore Commands (p. 30).  A default "fractint.par" file is
      included with the release.

    New &lt;z&gt; command allows changing fractal type-specific parameters
      without going back through the &lt;t&gt; (fractal type selection) screen.

    Ray tracer interface from Marc Reinig, generates 3d transform output
      for a number of ray tracers; see "Interfacing with Ray Tracing
      Programs" (p. 117)

    Selection of video modes and structure of "fractint.cfg" have changed.
      If you have a customized fractint.cfg file, you'll have to rebuild
      it based on this release's version. You can customize the assignment
      of your favorite video modes to function keys; see Video Mode
      Function Keys (p. 36).  &lt;delete&gt; is a new command key which goes
      directly to video mode selection.

    New "cyclerange" option (command line and &lt;y&gt; options screen) from
      Hugh Steele. Limits color cycling to a specified range of colors.

    Improved Distance Estimator Method (p. 91) algorithm from Phil
    Wilson.

    New "ranges=" option from Norman Hills.  See Logarithmic Palettes and
      Color Ranges (p. 93) for details.

    type=formula definitions can use "variable functions" to select sin,
      cos, sinh, cosh, exp, log, etc at run time; new built-ins tan, tanh,
      cotan, cotanh, and flip are available with type=formula; see Type
      Formula (p. 65)

    New &lt;w&gt; command in palette editing mode to convert image to greyscale

    All "fn" fractal types (e.g. fn*fn) can now use new functions tan,
      tanh, cotan, cotanh, recip, and ident; bug in prior cos function
      fixed, new function cosxx (conjugate of cos) is the old erroneous
      cos calculation
