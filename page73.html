  Color control:
      Cnn Select color nn
      &lt;nn Increment color by nn
      &gt;nn decrement color by nn

  Advanced commands:
      !     Reverse directions (Switch meanings of +, - and , /)
      @nnn  Multiply line segment size by nnn
            nnn may be a plain number, or may be preceded by
                I for inverse, or Q for square root.
                (e.g.  @IQ2 divides size by the square root of 2)
      [     Push.  Stores current angle and position on a stack
      ]     Pop.  Return to location of last push

  Other characters are perfectly legal in command strings.  They are
  ignored for drawing purposes, but can be used to achieve complex
  translations.

  The characters '+', '-', '&lt;', '&gt;', '[', ']', '|', '!', '@', '/', '\',
  and 'c' are reserved symbols and cannot be redefined.  For example,
  c=f+f and &lt;= , are syntax errors.

  The integer code produces incorrect results in five known instances,
  Peano2 with order &gt;= 7, SnowFlake1 with order &gt;=6, and SnowFlake2,
  SnowFlake3, and SnowflakeColor with order &gt;= 5.  If you see strange
  results, switch to the floating point code.


 2.40 Lyapunov Fractals

  (type=lyapunov)

  The Bifurcation fractal illustrates what happens in a simple population
  model as the growth rate increases.  The Lyapunov fractal expands that
  model into two dimensions by letting the growth rate vary in a periodic
  fashion between two values.  Each pair of growth rates is run through a
  logistic population model and a value called the Lyapunov Exponent is
  calculated for each pair and is plotted. The Lyapunov Exponent is
  calculated by adding up log | r - 2*r*x| over many cycles of the
  population model and dividing by the number of cycles. Negative Lyapunov
  exponents indicate a stable, periodic behavior and are plotted in color.
  Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos (or a diverging model) and
  are colored black.

  Order parameter.  Each possible periodic sequence yields a two
  dimensional space to explore.  The Order parameter selects a sequence.
  The default value 0 represents the sequence ab which alternates between
  the two values of the growth parameter.  On the screen, the a values run
  vertically and the b values run horizontally. Here is how to calculate
  the space parameter for any desired sequence.  Take your sequence of a's
  and b's and arrange it so that it starts with at least 2 a's and ends
  with a b. It may be necessary to rotate the sequence or swap a's and
  b's. Strike the first a and the last b off the list and replace each
  remaining a with a 1 and each remaining b with a zero.  Interpret this
  as a binary number and convert it into decimal.
