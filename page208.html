    of formulas expanded. Formulas in Orgform compilation caught by the
    new error checking have been rewritten.

  Fixed bug which appeared when an image entry and a formula in a .par
    file had the same name.

  Added support for formula type to SPACE Mandelbrot/Julia toggle.
    Implemented using new ismand parser constant.

  Added incremental redraw of images when maxiter is increased.  This
    works on completed images that use inside=color.  None of the other
    inside= options are supported.


  Version 19.6 (5/97) new features include:

  Added new fractal types escher_julia (p. 83) and volterra-lotka
    (p. 82) courtesy Michael Sargent.

  Expanded formula parser capability to recognize "if..else" flow control
    instructions. The format of an "if block" of instructions is:
           IF(boolean)
              statements
           ELSEIF(boolean) [any number of these are permitted in a block]
              statements
           ELSE            [if used, only one is permitted in a block]
              statements
           ENDIF
    Note that ELSEIF() does not require a separate ENDIF. Each branching
    instruction must be a separate formula statement, separated from other
    statements by a comma or an end of line. There is a limit of 200
    branching instructions per formula (ELSEIF counts as two branching
    instructions).  Unlimited nesting is permitted; each ELSEIF, ELSE, and
    ENDIF relates to the immediately preceding "non endif'ed" IF. An IF()
    and its ENDIF cannot traverse the end of the initialization section of
    the formula.

  Added tutorials to the distribution package: Bradley Beacham's basic
    formula tutorial, Sylvie Gallet's PHC and PTC formula tutorial, and
    George Martin's tutorial on the new if..else feature of the formula
    parser. Required reading for formula writers.

  Added text scrolling capability in &lt;z&gt; and F2 screens. Scroll keys for
    the &lt;z&gt; screen:
           CTRL+DOWN_ARROW    Move screen down one line
           CTRL+UP_ARROW      Move screen up one line
           CTRL+RIGHT_ARROW   Move screen right one column
           CTRL+LEFT_ARROW    Move screen left one column
           CTRL+PAGE_DOWN     Move screen down one view screen
           CTRL+PAGE_UP       Move screen up one view screen
           CTRL+HOME          Go to beginning of entry
           CTRL+END           Go to end of entry

    Direction keys without the CONTROL key depressed maintain their
    current roles in moving the cursor in the entry prompt boxes.
