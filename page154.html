  a non-standard manner that the BIOS does not recognize.

  Fractint also contains code that sets up the IBM (or any truly register-
  compatible) VGA adapter for several extended modes such as 704x528,
  736x552, 768x576, and 800x600. It does this by programming the VGA
  controller to use the fastest dot-clock on the IBM adapter (28.322 MHz),
  throwing more pixels, and reducing the refresh rate to make up for it.

  These modes push many monitors beyond their rated specs, in terms of
  both resolution and refresh rate. Signs that your monitor is having
  problems with a particular "tweaked" mode include:
   o vertical or horizontal overscan (displaying dots beyond the edges of
     your visible CRT area)
   o flickering (caused by a too-slow refresh rate)
   o vertical roll or total garbage on the screen (your monitor simply
     can't keep up, or is attempting to "force" the image into a pre-set
     mode that doesn't fit).

  We have successfully tested the modes up to 768x576 on an IBM PS/2 Model
  80 connected to IBM 8513, IBM 8514, NEC Multisync II, and Zenith 1490
  monitors (all of which exhibit some overscan and flicker at the highest
  rates), and have tested 800x600 mode on the NEC Multisync II (although
  it took some twiddling of the vertical-size control).

  SUPER-EGA AND SUPER-VGA MODES

  Since version 12.0, we've used both John Bridges' SuperVGA Autodetecting
  logic *and* VESA adapter detection, so that many brand-specific SuperVGA
  modes have been combined into single video mode selection entries.
  There is now exactly one entry for SuperVGA 640x480x256 mode, for
  instance.

  If Fractint's automatic SuperVGA/VESA detection logic guesses wrong, and
  you know which SuperVGA chipset your video adapter uses, you can use the
  "adapter=" command-line option to force Fractint to assume the presence
  of a specific SuperVGA Chipset - see Video Parameters (p. 134) for
  details.

  8514/A MODES

  The IBM 8514/A modes (640x480 and 1024x768) default to using the
  hardware registers.  If an error occurs when trying to open the adapter,
  an attempt will be made to use IBM's software interface, and requires
  the preloading of IBM's HDILOAD TSR utility.

  The Adex 1280x1024 modes were written for and tested on an Adex
  Corporation 8514/A using a Brooktree DAC.  The ATI GU 800x600x256 and
  1280x1024x16 modes require a ROM bios version of 1.3 or higher for
  800x600 and 1.4 or higher for 1280x1024.

  There are two sets of 8514/A modes: full sets (640x480, 800x600,
  1024x768, 1280x1024) which cover the entire screen and do NOT have a
  border color (so that you cannot tell when you are "paused" in a color-
  cycling mode), and partial sets (632x474, 792x594, 1016x762, 1272x1018)
  with small border areas which do turn white when you are paused in
  color-cycling mode. Also, while these modes are declared to be 256-
