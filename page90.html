        GOTO start
    GOTO is mainly useful for writing continuous loop demonstrations. It
    can also be useful when debugging an autokey file, to skip sections of
    it.

    ; -- A semi-colon indicates that the rest of the line containing it is
    a comment.

    MESSAGE nn &lt;Your message here&gt; -- Places a message on the top of the
    screen for nn seconds

  Making Fractint demos can be tricky. Here are some suggestions which may
  help:

    Start Fractint with "fractint autokeyname=mydemo.key autokey=record".
    Use a unique name each time you run so that you don't overwrite prior
    files.

    When in record mode, avoid using the cursor keys to select filenames,
    fractal types, formula names, etc. Instead, try to type in names. This
    will ensure that the exact item you want gets chosen during playback
    even if the list is different then.

    Beware of video mode assumptions. It is safest to build a separate
    demo for different resolution monitors.

    When in the record mode, try to type names quickly, then pause. If you
    pause partway through a name Fractint will break up the string in the
    .KEY file. E.g. if you paused in the middle of typing fract001, you
    might get:
        "fract"
        WAIT 2.2
        "001"
    No harm done, but messy to clean up. Fractint ignores pauses less than
    about 1/2 second.

    DO pause when you want the viewer to see what is happening during
    playback.

    When done recording, clean up your mydemo.key file. Insert a CALCWAIT
    after each keystroke which triggers something that takes a variable
    amount of time (calculating a fractal, restoring a file, saving a
    file).

    Add comments with ";" to the file so you know what is going on in
    future.

    It is a good idea to use INSERT before a GOTO which restarts the demo.
    The &lt;insert&gt; key resets Fractint as if you exited the program and
    restarted it.

  Warning: an autokey file built for this version of Fractint will
  probably require some retouching before it works with future releases of
  Fractint.  We have no intention of making sure that the same sequence of
  keystrokes will have exactly the same effect from one version of
  Fractint to the next. That would require pretty much freezing Fractint
