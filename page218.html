  Fixed Mandelbrot/Julia types with bailout less than 4 (try it, results
    are interesting!)

  Fixed browser delete feature which left a box on the screen after
    deleting and exiting browser feature.

  More changes in filename processing logic.  ".\" is now recognized as
    the current directory and is expanded to its full path name.  It is
    now possible, although not recommended, to designate the root
    directory of a disk as the desired search directory.

  Fixed integer math Mandelbrot bug for 286 or lower machines.

  Fixed problem of reading some Lsys files incorrectly (distribution
    PENROSE.L file was broken unless first line was commented.)

  Fixed problem that caused endless loop in RDS with bad input values.

  Made reading the current directory first optional, added the new
    curdir=yes command for times when you want to use current directory
    files.

  Fixed problem with complexpower() function ("x^y" formula operator) in
    the case where x == 0. (Note that formulas where 0^0 appears for every
    every pixel are considered broken and no promises made.)

  Prevented aspect ratio drift as you zoom. If you want to make tiny
    adjustments, use new ASPECTDRIFT=0 command.

  Inside=bof60 and bof61 options now work correctly with the formula
  parser.

  We discovered the calculation time is no good after 24 days, so instead
    of the time you will now get the message "A Really Long Time!!! (&gt;
    24.855 days)".  We thought you'd like to know ... A prize for the
    first person who actually *sees* this message!

  A summary of features new with 19.0 begins on next page.
