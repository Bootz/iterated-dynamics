 1.3 Zoom box Commands

  Zoom Box functions can be invoked while an image is being generated or
  when it has been completely drawn.  Zooming is supported for most
  fractal types, but not all.

  The general approach to using the zoom box is:  Frame an area using the
  keys described below, then &lt;Enter&gt; to expand what's in the frame to fill
  the whole screen (zoom in); or &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; to shrink the current image
  into the framed area (zoom out). With a mouse, double-click the left
  button to zoom in, double click the right button to zoom out.

  &lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Page Down&gt;
  Use &lt;Page Up&gt; to initially bring up the zoom box. It starts at full
  screen size. Subsequent use of these keys makes the zoom box smaller or
  larger.  Using &lt;Page Down&gt; to enlarge the zoom box when it is already at
  maximum size removes the zoom box from the display. Moving the mouse
  away from you or toward you while holding the left button down performs
  the same functions as these keys.

  Using the cursor "arrow" keys or moving the mouse without holding any
  buttons down, moves the zoom box.

  Holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; while pressing cursor "arrow" keys moves the box 5 times
  faster.  (This only works with enhanced keyboards.)

  Panning: If you move a fullsize zoombox and don't change anything else
  before performing the zoom, Fractint just moves what's already on the
  screen and then fills in the new edges, to reduce drawing time. This
  feature applies to most fractal types but not all.  A side effect is
  that while an image is incomplete, a full size zoom box moves in steps
  larger than one pixel.  Fractint keeps the box on multiple pixel
  boundaries, to make panning possible.  As a multi-pass (e.g. solid
  guessing) image approaches completion, the zoom box can move in smaller
  increments.

  In addition to resizing the zoom box and moving it around, you can do
  some rather warped things with it.  If you're a new Fractint user, we
  recommend skipping the rest of the zoom box functions for now and coming
  back to them when you're comfortable with the basic zoom box functions.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Keypad-&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Keypad+&gt;
  Holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; and pressing the numeric keypad's + or - keys rotates the
  zoom box. Moving the mouse left or right while holding the right button
  down performs the same function.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Page Down&gt;
  These commands change the zoom box's "aspect ratio", stretching or
  shrinking it vertically. Moving the mouse away from you or toward you
  while holding both buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse)
  down performs the same function. There are no commands to directly
  stretch or shrink the zoom box horizontally - the same effect can be
  achieved by combining vertical stretching and resizing.
