  If the screen initially contains an image, the path of the ant changes.
  To try this, generate a fractal, and press &lt;Ctrl-a&gt;. Note that images
  seeded with an image are not (yet) reproducible in PAR files. When
  started using the &lt;Ctrl-a&gt; keys, after the ant is finished the default
  fractal type reverts to that of the underlying fractal.

  Special keystrokes are in effect during the ant's march. The &lt;space&gt; key
  toggles a step-by-step mode. When in this mode, press &lt;enter&gt; to see
  each step of the ant's progress. When orbit delay (on &lt;p&gt; screen) is set
  to 1, the step mode is the default.

  If you press the right or left arrow during the ant's journey, you can
  adjust the orbit delay factor with the arrow keys (increment by 10) or
  ctrl-arrow keys (increment by 100). Press any other key to get out of
  the orbit delay adjustment mode. Higher values cause slower motion.
  Changed values are not saved after the ant is finished, but you can set
  the orbit delay value in advance from the &lt;p&gt; screen.


 2.49 Phoenix

  (type=phoenix, mandphoenix, phoenixcplx, mandphoenixclx)

  The phoenix type defaults to the original phoenix curve discovered by
  Shigehiro Ushiki, "Phoenix", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems,
  Vol. 35, No. 7, July 1988, pp. 788-789.  These images do not have the X
  and Y axis swapped as is normal for this type.

  The mandphoenix type is the corresponding Mandelbrot set image of the
  phoenix type.  The spacebar toggles between the two as long as the
  mandphoenix type has an initial z(0) of (0,0).  The mandphoenix is not
  an effective index to the phoenix type, so explore the wild blue yonder.

  To reproduce the Mandelbrot set image of the phoenix type as shown in
  Stevens' book, "Fractal Programming in C", set initorbit=0/0 on the
  command line or with the &lt;g&gt; key.  The colors need to be rotated one
  position because Stevens uses the values from the previous calculation
  instead of the current calculation to determine when to bailout.

  The phoenixcplx type is implemented using complex constants instead of
  the real constants that Stevens used.  This recreates the mapping as
  originally presented by Ushiki.

  The mandphoenixclx type is the corresponding Mandelbrot set image of the
  phoenixcplx type.  The spacebar toggles between the two as long as the
  mandphoenixclx type has a perturbation of z(0) = (0,0).  The
  mandphoenixclx is an effective index to the phoenixcplx type.


 2.50 Frothy Basins

  (type=frothybasin)

  Frothy Basins, or Riddled Basins, were discovered by James C. Alexander
  of the University of Maryland.  The discussion below is derived from a
  two page article entitled "Basins of Froth" in Science News, November
