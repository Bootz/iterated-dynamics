    Added outside=fmod option.  This is an extension of the inside=fmod
    option.  The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the
    same calculation as is used for the bailout test.  This feature was
    contributed by Iain Stirling.  There is a problem with the mandel
    fractal type when outside=fmod is used with inside=bof6x and
    bailoutest=real, imag, or manr.  This is likely due to changes made in
    the code so that bof images could be reproduced.  Select a different
    fractal type that produces the default mandel image to explore using
    these parameters.

    Added outside=tdis option.  This colors the pixels according to the
    total distance traveled by the orbit.  This feature was suggested by
    Steve Robinson on the Fractint Wish List.

    Modified the inside and outside prompts on the &lt;x&gt; screen.  They are
    now split into two separate prompts.  One for entering a color number
    and the other for changing the option.  The left and right arrow keys
    can now be used to change the inside and outside options.

    Fixed a bug that was causing a crash when mathtolerance= was used and
    fractal types ifs, ifs3d, or lsystem were selected.

    Increased the minimum stack requirement for passes=s (SOI) to
    eliminate crashes when the tab key was pressed.

  Patch 15
  Added a prompt for the periodicity= option to the &lt;y&gt; Extended Options
    screen.

    Fixed another prompt problem with the stereogram prompt screen.  Put
    back in the evolver grid size limit based on screen resolution.

    Fixed an evolver save problem when a zoom box was present just prior
    to the save.  Note that the center image cannot be recreated once the
    zoom box has been activated.  This is not a problem if you are working
    from a saved image, just restore it.

    Modified the routine that reports a view window that is too large so
    that along with the full screen being used, the X and Y dimensions on
    the &lt;v&gt; screen reflect the full screen dimensions.

    The &lt;v&gt; screen can now be used to set the resolution of disk video
    modes.  The limit is 32767x32767.  First select a disk video mode
    using &lt;del&gt;.  Then on the &lt;v&gt; screen enter both an X and a Y value.
    If you go back to the &lt;del&gt; screen to see if the entry has been
    modified (it hasn't), you will get strange results if you don't select
    a video mode.

  Patch 14
  Fixed the generation of random numbers used by the evolver subimages.
    Fixed the bug causing completed evolver images to regenerate when
    restored.

  Patch 13
  Added parameters p4 and p5 to the formula parser.  Fixed the symmetry
    for cases where XAXIS_NOREAL and XAXIS_NOIMAG are used with the
