  Real starfields have many more dim stars than bright ones because very
  few stars are close enough to appear bright.  To achieve this effect the
  program will create a bell curve based on the value of ratio of Dim
  stars to bright stars.  After calculating the bell curve the curve is
  folded in half and the peak used to represent the number of dim stars.

  Starfields can only be shown in 256 colors.  Fractint will automatically
  try to load ALTERN.MAP and abort if the map file cannot be found.


 3.11 Bailout Test

  The bailout test is used to determine if we should stop iterating before
  the maximum iteration count is reached.  This test compares the value
  determined by the test to the "bailout" value set via the &lt;Z&gt; screen.
  The default bailout test compares the magnitude or modulus of a complex
  variable to some bailout value:

  bailout test = |z| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) &gt;= 2

  As a computational speedup, we square both sides of this equation and the
  bailout test used by Fractint is:

  bailout test = |z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 &gt;= 4

  Using a "bailout" other than 4 allows us to change when the bailout will occur.

  The following bailout tests have been implemented on the &lt;Z&gt; screen:

     mod:     x^2 + y^2 &gt;= bailout

     real:    x^2       &gt;= bailout

     imag:    y^2       &gt;= bailout

     or:      x^2 &gt;= bailout  or   y^2 &gt;= bailout

     and:     x^2 &gt;= bailout  and  y^2 &gt;= bailout

     manh:    (abs(x) + abs(y))^2 &gt;= bailout  (based on Manhattan metric)

     manr:    (x + y)^2 &gt;= bailout

  The bailout test feature has not been implemented for all applicable
  fractal types.  This is due to the speedups used for these types.  Some
  of these bailout tests show the limitations of the integer math routines
  by clipping the spiked ends off of the protrusions.


 3.12 Parameter Explorer/Evolver

   Since fractint is such a wonderfully complex program it has more than a
   few parameters to tweak and options to select. To the inexperienced
   user the choice is bewildering.  Even for the experts the chaotic
   nature of the mathematical processes involved make it difficult to know
   what to change in order to achieve the desired effect.
