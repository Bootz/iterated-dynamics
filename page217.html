  Version 19.2 is a bug-fix release for version 19.1. Changes from 19.1 to
    19.2 include:

  Fixed the 3D function, which was broken in 19.1 due to a side-effect of
    a repair of a minor bug in 19.0. Arrgghh! This is the main reason for
    the release of this version so quickly.

  Fixed a bug that caused the Julia inverse window and the orbits window
    to lose their place after loading a color map.

  Fixed a bug that causes corners to be lost when too many digits are
  entered.

  Added an enhanced ants automaton by Luciano Genero and Fulvio Cappelli.

  New showorbit command allows orbits-during-generation feature to be
    turned on by default. Expanded limits of Hertz command to 20 to 15000.

  Targa 3D files are now correctly written to workdir rather than tempdir.

  Uncommented garbage between file entries is now ignored. (But note that
    "{" must be on same line as entry name.)

  Fixed savename update logic.

  Version 19.1 is a bug-fix release for version 19.0. Changes from 19.0 to
    19.1 include:

  Disabled the F6 (corners) key when in the parameters screen (&lt;z&gt;) for
    arbitrary precision.

  IFS formulas now show in &lt;z&gt; screen.

  Allow RDS image maps of arbitrary dimensions.

  Touched up Mandelbrot/Julia &lt;Space&gt; toggle logic.

  Fractint now remembers map name, and uses the mapfile path correctly,
    and now allows periods in directory names.

  Fixed tab bug that caused problems when interrupting a restore of an
    arbitrary precision image.

  Repaired savename logic. No longer show (usually truncated) full path of
    the saved file in the screen.

  Fixed double to arbitrary precision transition with 90 degree images.
    (This only failed before when the image was rotated exactly 90
    degrees.)

  Corrected docs directory errors that reported several commands such as
    PARDIR= that were not implemented. Documented the color cycling HOME
    function.
