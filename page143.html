  LINEFEED=crlf|lf|cr
  Specifies the control characters to emit at end of each line:  carriage
  return and linefeed, just linefeed, or just carriage return.  The
  default is crlf.

  TITLE=yes
  If specified, title information is added to printouts.

  PRINTFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\]filename
  Causes output data for the printer to be written to the named file on
  disk instead of to a printer port. The filename is incremented by 1 each
  time an image is printed - e.g. if the name is FRAC01.PRN, the second
  print operation writes to FRAC02.PRN, etc. Existing files are not
  overwritten - if the file exists, the filename is incremented to a new
  name.


 5.15 PostScript Parameters

  EPSF=1|2|3
  Forces print-to-file and PostScript. If PRINTFILE is not specified, the
  default filename is FRACT001.EPS. The number determines how 'well-
  behaved' a .EPS file is. 1 means by-the-book. 2 allows some EPS 'no-nos'
  like settransfer and setscreen - BUT includes code that should make the
  code still work without affecting the rest of the non-EPS document. 3 is
  a free-for-all.

  COLORPS=yes|no - Enable or disable the color extensions.

  RLEPS=yes|no
  Enable or disable run length encoding of the PostScript file.  Run
  length encoding will make the PostScript file much smaller, but it may
  take longer to print.  The run length encoding code is based on pnmtops,
  which is copyright (C) 1989 by Jef Poskanzer, and carries the following
  notice: "Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software

  both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation.  This software is provided "as is" without
  express or implied warranty."

  TRANSLATE=yes|-n|n
  Translate=yes prints the negative image of the fractal.  Translate=n
  reduces the image to that many colors. A negative value causes a color
  reduction as well as a negative image.

  HALFTONE=frq/ang/sty[/f/a/s/f/a/s/f/a/s]
  Tells the PostScript printer how to define its halftone screen. The
  first value, frequency, defines the number of halftone lines per inch.
  The second chooses the angle (in degrees) that the screen lies at. The
  third option chooses the halftone 'spot' style. Good default frequencies
  are between 60 and 80; Good default angles are 45 and 0; the default
  style is 0. If the halftone= option is not specified, Fractint will
  print using the printer's default halftone screen, which should have
  been already set to do a fine job on the printer.
