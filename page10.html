    Fixed an evolver bug that was causing the evolver to not exit cleanly.

    Changed the compile options on evolve.c to eliminate aliasing, which
    started to cause problems with this patch.

  Patch 12
  Fixed a problem with a finished image not redrawing if the maxiter was
    increased and another parameter was changed.

    Added checks for p3, p4, and p5 to the browser for determining similar
    images.

  Xfractint fixes: Fixed the command line -disk segmentation fault.

    Fixed the Shell to Linux/Unix segmentation fault and the displayed
    prompt.

    Fixed the bug causing colors= data to be incorrect when in a truecolor
    mode.

    Removed or commented out extra lines of code and some experimental
    routines.  Some of this code was stealing key strokes.

    Changed the prompt for getting to the second &lt;TAB&gt; screen.

  Patch 11
  Fixed a bug that caused a panned image to miss part of a line when the
    image was panned while the first row was being generated.

    Adjusted the time for keyboard checks when the showdot feature is
    used.  Now the iterations stop much quicker when a key is pressed.

    Fixed a problem with the float-only version that appeared when an
    incomplete image was saved and restarted in the standard version.

    Fixed a problem in Xfractint pointed out by Ken on the Fractint bug
    list.

  Patch 10
  Took out a sanity check in the VESA detection routines that certain
    graphics cards don't pass, but work fine anyway.

  Patch 9
  Fixed evolver bug that occurred when some formula functions were evolved
    and others were not being evolved.

    Fixed a bug in the float-only version which truncated the image
    coordinates when saved to a PAR.

  Patch 8
  Added truecolor support to Fractint thanks to Bert Tyler.  While in a
    truecolor mode, the following features are disabled/changed:
      Color Cycling
      Palette Editor brings up the contents of the MAP directory
      Saving the image still only produces a 256 color GIF
