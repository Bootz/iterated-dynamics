  Fixed the complexnewton type when used with a par/gif release &lt;= 1920.

  Changed the keystroke behavior of the passes= field on the &lt;x&gt; screen.

  New logic autocenters all input screen menu titles.

  Changed the automatic resolution switching logic between float and
    arbitrary precision.

  If user aborts before selecting a file in a file menu screen, the
    program now remembers the last file name selected even if the
    directory has been changed.

  Fixed writing 3d smooth factor to PAR.

  Fixed writing potential to PAR in makepar mode.

  Fixed redundant "Regenerate before &lt;b&gt; to get correct symmetry" messages
    in divide and conquer mode.

  Fixed hi rez type 2 diffusion bug and parser error bug.

  Fixed crashing in disk video with too long a savename path.

  Added Adrian Mariano's diffusion fixes - a new color option, several bug
    fixes, and improved documentation. Removed integer support which
    wasn't being used anyway.

  Finally, we've added two undocumented commands to give expert users
     workarounds for math type precision and GIF encoder problems.

  Added the mathtolerance=.05/.05 command. The first number controls the
    integer/float transition, and the second number controls the
    float/arbitrary precision transition. The default value of .05 means
    that the ratio between the exact and calculated width and height is
    between .95 and 1.05. A larger value than .05 (say .10) makes the test
    looser so that the lower precision math is used longer. A value &lt;= 0
    means the test is always failed and the higher precision math type is
    used. A value &gt;= 1 means that the test is always passed and the lower
    precision math type is used.

    The automatic precision toggle is resolution dependent. The same image
    may use float at 320x200 and arbitrary precision at 640x480. This is
    not a bug; it has to work this way. At a given magnification more
    pixels require more precision. There are other tests so even with
    mathtolerance=1/.05, eventually Fractint will have to use float. The
    same is not true for mathtolerance=.05/1. If you keep zooming Fractint
    will not rescue you; eventually you'll get a nasty error message and
    the corners will be lost.

  Added the tweaklzw=nnn/nnn command. Fractint's GIF encoder occasionally
    fails and produces bad GIF files. Tweaking encoder parameters might
    allow saving in such a situation. The parameters reduce the maximum
    size of the current string and maximum total length of the string
    table, respectively. The default values are 0, which gives the old
    encoder performance.
