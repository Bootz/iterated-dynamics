  spacebar toggle, if that method is used). The exponent is a positive
  integer or a complex number. We call these "families" because each value
  of the exponent yields a different MarksMandel set, which turns out to
  be a kinda-polygon with (exponent) sides. The exponent value is the
  third parameter, after the "initialization warping" values. Typically
  one would use null warping values, and specify the exponent with
  something like "PARAMS=0/0/5", which creates an unwarped, pentagonal
  MarksMandel set.

  In the process of coding MarksMandelPwr formula type, Tim Wegner created
  the type "tim's_error" after making an interesting coding mistake.


 2.22 Unity

  (type=unity)

  This Peterson variation began with curiosity about other "Newton-style"
  approximation processes. A simple one,

     One = (x * x) + (y * y); y = (2 - One) * x;   x = (2 - One) * y;

  produces the fractal called Unity.

  One of its interesting features is the "ghost lines." The iteration loop
  bails out when it reaches the number 1 to within the resolution of a
  screen pixel. When you zoom a section of the image, the bailout
  criterion is adjusted, causing some lines to become thinner and others
  thicker.

  Only one line in Unity that forms a perfect circle: the one at a radius
  of 1 from the origin. This line is actually infinitely thin. Zooming on
  it reveals only a thinner line, up (down?) to the limit of accuracy for
  the algorithm. The same thing happens with other lines in the fractal,
  such as those around |x| = |y| = (1/2)^(1/2) = .7071

  Try some other tortuous approximations using the TEST stub (p. 64) and
  let us know what you come up with!


 2.23 Scott Taylor / Lee Skinner Variations

  (type=fn(z*z), fn*fn, fn*z+z, fn+fn, fn+fn(pix), sqr(1/fn), sqr(fn),
  spider, tetrate, manowar)

  Two of Fractint's faithful users went bonkers when we introduced the
  "formula" type, and came up with all kinds of variations on escape-time
  fractals using trig functions.  We decided to put them in as regular
  types, but there were just too many! So we defined the types with
  variable functions and let you, the overwhelmed user, specify what the
  functions should be! Thus Scott Taylor's "z = sin(z) + z^2" formula type
  is now the "fn+fn" regular type, and EITHER function can be one of sin,
  cos, tan, cotan, sinh, cosh, tanh, cotanh, exp, log, sqr, recip, ident,
  zero, one, conj, flip, cosxx, asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh,
  sqrt, abs, or cabs.
