  Hitting the space bar toggles between continuously generating the
  cellular automata and stopping at the end of the current screen.

 2.48 Ant Automaton

  (type=ant)

  This fractal type is the generalized Ant Automaton described in the
  "Computer Recreations" column of the July 1994 Scientific American. The
  article attributes this automaton to Greg Turk of Stanford University,
  Leonid A.  Bunivomitch of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and S. E.
  Troubetzkoy of the University of Bielefeld.

  The ant wanders around the screen, starting at the middle. A rule
  string, which the user can input as Fractint's first parameter,
  determines the ant's direction. This rule string is stored as a double
  precision number in our implementation. Only the digit 1 is significant
  -- all other digits are treated as 0. When the type 1 ant leaves a cell
  (a pixel on the screen) of color k, it turns right if the kth symbol in
  the rule string is a 1, or left otherwise. Then the color in the
  abandoned cell is incremented. The type 2 ant uses only the rule string
  to move around. If the digit of the rule string is a 1, the ant turns
  right and puts a zero in current cell, otherwise it turns left and put a
  number in the current cell. An empty rule string causes the rule to be
  generated randomly.

  Fractint's 2nd parameter is a maximum iteration to guarantee that the
  fractal will terminate.

  The 3rd parameter is the number of ants (up to 256). If you select 0
  ants, then the number oif ants is random.

  The 4th paramter allows you to select ant type 1 (the original), or type
  2.

  The 5th parameter determines whether the ant's progress stops when the
  edge of the screen is reaches (as in the original implementation), or
  whether the ant's path wraps to the opposite side of the screen. You can
  slow down the ant to see her better using the &lt;p&gt; screen Orbit Delay -
  try 10.

  The 6th parameter accepts a random seed, allowing you to duplicate
  images using random values (empty rule string or 0 maximum ants.

  Try rule string 10. In this case, the ant moves in a seemingly random
  pattern, then suddenly marches off in a straight line. This happens for
  many other rule strings. The default 1100 produces symmetrical images.
