 3.3 Autokey Mode

  The autokey feature allows you to set up beautiful self-running demo
  "loops". You can set up hypnotic sequences to attract people to a booth,
  to generate sequences for special effects, to teach how Fractal
  exploring is done, etc.

  A sample autokey file (DEMO.KEY) and a batch to run it (DEMO.BAT) are
  included with Fractint. Type "demo" at the DOS prompt to run it.

  Autokey record mode is enabled with the command line parameter
  "AUTOKEY=RECORD". Keystrokes are saved in an intelligible text format in
  a file called AUTO.KEY. You can change the file name with the
  "AUTOKEYNAME=" parameter.

  Playback is enabled with the parameter "AUTOKEY=PLAY". Playback can be
  terminated by pressing the &lt;Esc&gt; key.

  After using record mode to capture an autokey file, you'll probably want
  to touch it up using your editor before playing it back.

  Separate lines are not necessary but you'll probably find it easier to
  understand an autokey file if you put each command on a separate line.
  Autokey files can contain the following:

    Quoted strings. Fractint reads whatever is between the quotes just as
    if you had typed it. For example,
        "t" "ifs" issues the "t" (type) command and then enters the
    letters i", "f", and "s" to select the ifs type.

    Symbols for function keys used to select a video mode. Examples:
        F3  -- Function key 3
        SF3 --&lt;Shift&gt; and &lt;F3&gt; together

    Special keys: ENTER ESC F1 PAGEUP PAGEDOWN HOME END LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN
    INSERT DELETE TAB CTRL_RIGHT CTRL_LEFT CTRL_DOWN CTRL_UP CTRL_HOME
    CTRL_END

    WAIT &lt;nnn.n&gt; -- wait nnn.n seconds before continuing

    CALCWAIT -- pause until the current fractal calculation or file save
    or restore is finished. This command makes demo files more robust
    since calculation times depend on the  speed of the machine running
    the demo - a "WAIT 10" command may allow enough time to complete a
    fractal on one machine, but not on another. The record mode does not
    generate this command - it should be added by hand to the autokey file
    whenever there is a process that should be allowed to run to
    completion.

    GOTO target -- The autokey file continues to be read from the label
    "target". The label can be any word that does not duplicate a key
    word.  It must be present somewhere in the autokey file with a colon
    after it.  Example:
        MESSAGE 2 This is executed once
        start:
        MESSAGE 2 This is executed repeatedly
