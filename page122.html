  Formulas, ifs, and lsystem entries referred to in a parameter entry can
  be included in a .par file by adding the prefix frm:, ifs:, or lsys:
  respectively, for example frm:myformula {rest of that formula}.
  Note that the prefix is a label, not part of the formula name, so the
  reference in the image entry would be formulaname=myformula. The
  formula, ifs, and lsystem entries added to a parfile are accessed only
  when the image entry in the parfile is run. To make these formulas
  generally
  accessible, they must be added to a .frm, .ifs or .l file (without the
  identifier prefix, of course).

  See "Parameter Save/Restore Commands" (p. 30) for details about the &lt;@&gt;
  and &lt;B&gt; commands.


 5.4 General Parameter Syntax

  Parameters must be separated by one or more spaces.

  Upper and lower case can be used in keywords and values.

  Anything on a line following a ; (semi-colon) is ignored, i.e. is a
  comment.

  In parameter files and SSTOOLS.INI:
    o Individual parameters can be entered on separate lines.
    o Long values can be split onto multiple lines by ending a line with a
      \ (backslash) - leading spaces on the following line are ignored,
      the information on the next line from the first non-blank character
      onward is appended to the prior line.

  Some terminology:
    KEYWORD=nnn              enter a number in place of "nnn"
    KEYWORD=[filename]       you supply filename
    KEYWORD=yes|no|whatever  choose one of "yes", "no", or "whatever"
    KEYWORD=1st[/2nd[/3rd]]  the slash-separated parameters "2nd" and
                             "3rd" are optional


 5.5 Startup Parameters

  @FILENAME
  Causes Fractint to read "filename" for parameters. When it finishes, it
  resumes reading its own command line -- i.e., "FRACTINT MAXITER=250
  @MYFILE PASSES=1" is legal. This option is only valid on the DOS command
  line, as Fractint is not clever enough to deal with multiple
  indirection.

  @FILENAME/GROUPNAME
  Like @FILENAME, but reads a named group of parameters from a parameter
  file.  See "Parameter Files and the &lt;@&gt; Command" (p. 121).

  TEMPDIR=[directory]
  This command allows to specify the directory where Fractint writes
  temporary files.
