    In the F2 screen, the same scrolling is available; the CONTROL key
    does not need to be depressed.

  Added capability to place ifs, formula, and lsys entries in PAR files.
    If not found in the file named in the parameter entry, formulas, ifs,
    and lsystem entries called for in entries are looked for in the .par
    file itself. The referenced entry must have the appropriate prefix in
    the PAR file as follows:

         formulas  frm:
         lsystem   lsys:
         ifs       ifs:

    for example:

    frm:mandel {
      z=c=pixel:
      z = z*z + c
      |z| &lt; 4
    }

    The prefix is an identifier, not part of the name itself. Thus, the
    parameter in the image entry would read "formulaname=mandel". The
    formulafile= parameter need not, and probably should not, name the PAR
    file itself - the search of the PAR file is automatic.

    Formulas, ifs, and lsys entries in a PAR file will not be shown on the
    menu screen for the PAR file, and are accessible only in connection
    with running the parameter entry which calls for the formula. Also,
    PAR files are not searched when looking for a formula, ifs, or lsystem
    entry in connection with restoring a .gif file. You will need to copy
    these entries from the PAR file into .frm, .ifs, and .l files as
    applicable (taking care, of course, to delete the identifier prefixes)
    in order to make general use of them.

  Added command line option fastrestore=yes|no. Default is NO. When YES,
    causes viewwindows to be set to NO before each restore, so that
    otherwise normal gifs will not be drawn at the reduced aspect when
    viewwindows was previously set to YES; and bypasses the warning which
    is displayed when a restore is to be viewed in a video mode other than
    the one at which the gif was saved. Combined with askvideo=no, all
    restores will automatically be made at the user's default video mode.
    This feature will be helpful when cycling through a group of gifs in
    autokey mode.

  Ctrl-Right used in file selection screens now skips over directory
    listings, and if the cursor is on the last file, moves the cursor to
    the first file.  This makes possible uninterrupted cycling in autokey
    mode. The keyword for this keystroke in a .key file is CTRL_RIGHT.
    The following additional keystrokes were also implemented:

         Ctrl-Left (autokey symbol "CTRL_LEFT")
         Ctrl-Down ("CTRL_DOWN")
         Ctrl-Up   ("CTRL_UP")
         Ctrl-Home ("CTRL_HOME")
         Ctrl-End  ("CTRL_END")
