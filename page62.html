  *inside* the Lorenz orbits.  Here comes one - Duck!  While you are at
  it, turn on the sound with the "X". This way you'll at least hear it
  coming!

  Different Lorenz attractors can be created using different parameters.
  Four parameters are used. The first is the time-step (dt). The default
  value is .02. A smaller value makes the plotting go slower; a larger
  value is faster but rougher. A line is drawn to connect successive orbit
  values.  The 2nd, third, and fourth parameters are coefficients used in
  the differential equation (a, b, and c). The default values are 5, 15,
  and 1.  Try changing these a little at a time to see the result.


 2.28 Rossler Attractors

  (type=rossler3D)

  This fractal is named after the German Otto Rossler, a non-practicing
  medical doctor who approached chaos with a bemusedly philosophical
  attitude.  He would see strange attractors as philosophical objects. His
  fractal namesake looks like a band of ribbon with a fold in it. All we
  can say is we used the same calculus-teacher-defeating trick of
  multiplying the equations by "dt" to solve the differential equation and
  generate the orbit.  This time we will skip straight to the orbit
  generator - if you followed what we did above with type Lorenz (p. 61)
  you can easily reverse engineer the differential equations.

               xnew = x - y*dt -   z*dt
               ynew = y + x*dt + a*y*dt
               znew = z + b*dt + x*z*dt - c*z*dt

  Default parameters are dt = .04, a = .2, b = .2, c = 5.7


 2.29 Henon Attractors

  (type=henon)

  Michel Henon was an astronomer at Nice observatory in southern France.
  He came to the subject of fractals via investigations of the orbits of
  astronomical objects.  The strange attractor most often linked with
  Henon's name comes not from a differential equation, but from the world
  of discrete mathematics - difference equations. The Henon map is an
  example of a very simple dynamic system that exhibits strange behavior.
  The orbit traces out a characteristic banana shape, but on close
  inspection, the shape is made up of thicker and thinner parts.  Upon
  magnification, the thicker bands resolve to still other thick and thin
  components.  And so it goes forever! The equations that generate this
  strange pattern perform the mathematical equivalent of repeated
  stretching and folding, over and over again.

               xnew =  1 + y - a*x*x
               ynew =  b*x
