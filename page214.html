  Added better math function error trapping for the formula parser. This
    can change the rendering of some PAR files using type=formula. If
    reset=1920 is included in the PAR file, the new error trapping is
    disabled.

  Fixed an old, rare, but nasty bug that stripped trailing zeros from the
    exponents of floating point numbers written to PAR files.

  Ctrl-ins and Ctrl-Del now change the browser frame colors.

  Fixed bug that occurred when writing PAR files containing a video= line
    with a four character video mode.

  Added batch facility to copy fractal information and color in GIFs to
    PAR format.

  Added current column to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

  Removed support for reading Targa files.

  Added backwards compatibility for the fractal type fn(z*z).

  Added support for expanded and extended memory to the browser.  Use
    expanded memory if you don't have at least 4 MB of extended memory.

  Added pi and e to constants that the formula parser recognizes.  Fixed
    parser so that constants are recognized correctly.

  Added docs for freestyle mode in the colour editor.

  Fixed bug involving comments between formula entries.

  Allow renaming Fractint.exe without losing access to fractint's help
  files.

  Center-mag is now the default method for storing coordinates in PAR
  files.

  Increased limit on number of operations in a formula entry from 250 to
    over 2000. In most cases memory use is actually less than before
    because of use of existing memory arrays.

  Fixed a bug that caused the image to regenerate when the &lt;y&gt; screen was
    accessed, but nothing was changed (or color cycle range was changed).

  Fixed a bug that caused saved partial images that used logmap to use the
    incorrect logmap routine when restored (GIFs &amp; PARs).

  Made the solid guessing stop pass parameter save to GIFs and PARS.

  Added truecolor=yes command. This causes the iterations for each point
    to be written to a 24-bit Targa truecolor file called iterates.tga.
    Maxiter is also written to the file. This allows a simple outboard
    program to assign truecolors to iterations. Passes=1 is forced, but
    symmetry works.  (This function may go away in the future when real
    truecolor support is implemented.)
