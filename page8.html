    Fixed evolver parameter entry.

    Fixed hypercomplex fractal type to turn off symmetry when a cj
    parameter is used.

    Fixed the plasma type to show the value of the parameter that is
    actually used in the image generation.

    Fixed the plasma type so that a parameter file uses the colors
    included in the parameter entry instead of the default colors.

    Revised the plasma type prompt to reflect the values that can actually
    be used.

    Increased the Lsystem line length from 160 characters to 255
    characters.

    Fixed the browser so that it recognized the fractal type stored in
    images.

    Fixed the Xfractint FPUcplxdiv and FPUcplxlog routines in fpu087.c to
    match the Fractint assembler code.

    Modified the Xfractint resume code to remove the Xfractint specific
    sections since they are no longer needed (gcc macros match MSC
    macros).

  Patch 5
  Made changes to allow Xfractint to find files that use upper case
  letters.

    Fixed a problem with the Cellular type that prevented entering an
    initial row of greater than 32767 from working.  Added a message about
    not being able to resume after interrupting prior to rows being
    displayed on screen.

    Fixed an evolver bug which caused setting evolver parameters to turn
    evolving on, even though evolving was actually turned off.

    Added Charlie Chernohorsky's truecolor speed up and his implementation
    of virtual screen sizes for the VESA modes (dotmode=28).  This feature
    does not work consistently between different video cards, so it may be
    turned off by using the startup command "virtual=n".  Use the &lt;V&gt;
    screen to set the desired virtual screen size.  See View Window
    (p. 34).  Please remember that if either X or Y is greater than 2048,
    solid guessing is turned off.  This is for multiple reasons, so it is
    likely it will NOT get fixed soon.  There is also a problem with the
    colorbars that appear when saving an image leaving bits of corruption
    on the screen.  This occurs in all the VESA truecolor modes.

    Added Charlie to the scrolling list of contributors.

    Added Charlie's fix for the l-system type which occurred when a push-
    pop combination was on two different lines.
