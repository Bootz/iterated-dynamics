     choice.

  Targa Output:

     If you want any of the 3d transforms you select to be saved as a
     Targa-24 file or overlayed onto one, select yes for this option.  The
     overlay option in the final screen determines whether you will create
     a new file or overlay an existing one.

  MAP File name:

     Imediately after selecting the previous options, you will be given
     the chance to select an alternate color MAP file. The default is to
     use the current MAP. If you want another MAP used, then enter your
     selection at this point.

  Output File Name:

     This is a ray tracing sub-option, used to specify the name of the
     file to be written.  The default name is FRACT001.RAY.  The name is
     incremented by one each time a file is written.  If you have not set
     "overwrite=yes" then the file name will also be automatically
     incremented to avoid over-writing previous files.

  When you are satisfied with your selections press enter to go to the
  next parameter screen.


 4.2 Select Fill Type Screen

  This option exists because in the course of the 3D projection, portions
  of the original image may be stretched to fit the new surface. Points of
  an image that formerly were right next to each other, now may have a
  space between them. This option generally determines what to do with the
  space between the mapped dots. It is not used if you have selected a
  value for RAY other than 0.

  For an illustration, pick the second option "just draw the points",
  which just maps points to corresponding points. Generally this will
  leave empty space between many of the points. Therefore you can choose
  various algorithms that "fill in" the space between the points in
  various ways.

  Later, try the first option "make a surface grid." This option will make
  a grid of the surface which is as many divisions in the original "y"
  direction as was set in "coarse" in the first screen. It is very fast,
  and can give you a good idea what the final relationship of parts of
  your picture will look like.

  Later, try the second option "connect the dots (wire frame)", then
  "surface fills" - "colors interpolated" and "colors not interpolated",
  the general favorites of the authors. Solid fill, while it reveals the
  pseudo-geology under your pseudo-landscape, inevitably takes longer.
