  Added autodetection and 640x480x256 support for the Compaq Advanced VGA
  Systems board - I wonder if it works?

  Added VGA register-compatible 320x240x256 video mode.

  Fixed the "logmap=yes" option to (again) take effect for continuous
  potential images.  This was broken in version 15.x.

  The colors for the floating-point algorithm of the Julia fractal now
  match the colors for the integer algorithm.

  If the GIF Encoder (the "Save" command) runs out of disk space, it now
  tells you about it.

  If you select both the boundary-tracing algorithm and either "inside=0"
  or "outside=0", the algorithm will now give you an error message instead
  of silently failing.

  Updated 3D logic from Marc Reinig.

  Minor changes to permit IFS3D fractal types to be handled properly using
  the "B" command.

  Minor changes to the "Obtaining the latest Source" section to refer to
  BBS access (Peter Longo's) and mailed diskettes (the Public (Software)
  Library).


  Version 16.12, 8/91

    Fix to cure some video problems reported with Amstrad 8088/8086-based
       PCs.

  Version 16.11, 7/91

    SuperVGA Autodetect fixed for older Tseng 3000 adapters.

    New "adapter=" options to force the selection of specific SuperVGA
       adapter types.  See Video Parameters (p. 134) for details.

    Integer/Floating-Point math toggle is changed only temporarily if
       floating-point math is forced due to deep zooming.

    Fractint now survives being modified by McAfee's "SCAN /AV" option.

    Bug Fixes for Acrospin interface, 3D "Light Source Before
       Transformation" fill type, and GIF decoder.

    New options in the &lt;Z&gt; parameters screen allow you to directly enter
       image coordinates.

    New "inside=zmag" and "outside=real|imag|mult|summ" options.

    The GIF Decoder now survives reading GIF files with a local color map.
    Improved IIT Math Coprocessor support.
