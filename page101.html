   Now set the first entry (param1) to 'x' and the second (param2) to 'y'.
   This tells Fractint to vary param1 (the real part of c) across the
   screen and param2 (the imaginary part of c) down the screen. Make sure
   all the other parameters are set to 'no' so that nothing else gets
   changed to confuse things.

   Press 'Return' to go back to the main evolver control screen and you'll
   see that a few more items have appeared. These control just how much
   the parameters are varied across the screen and what their starting
   values should be, leave them as they are but increase gridsz to 15.
   Also switch on the parameter zoom box option.

   When you exit this control screen with the 'Return' key, you'll see a
   grid of Julia sets generated all mapped out onto the imaginary plane,
   squint and you'll be able to spot the underlying Mset!

   When you press 'Pageup' this time you'll notice that there are two
   boxes on screen with a larger box centered around the normal selection
   box.  'Ctrl-pageup' or 'Ctrl-pagedown' varies the size of this box
   which represents the 'parameter' zoom box.  The parameter zoombox
   allows you to look at smaller areas of the parameter space in more
   detail. To explain this further look at how the Julia sets change
   across the screen, around the area of 'seahorse valley' on the
   underlying Mset, the Julia sets undergo a sharp change in character.
   This area of change can be examined in more detail using parameter
   zooming. Make the outer zoombox a few grids across and select an image
   in the area of this change with the outer box straddling it. Look at
   the images right in the corners of the parm zoombox, when you press
   'Enter' and a new generation of images is generated the same images
   will be in the corners of the screen with more sub images between them,
   allowing a finer look at how the change progresses.  In this way, you
   can observe the chaotic areas in parameter space with the unique pseudo
   four dimensional view offered by the explorer.

   In the example shown above, you were just exploring the variation in
   two 'real' parameters, i.e. they can take fractional values, and the
   idea of being able to create an image half way between two others is
   valid. However, many of the parameters in fractint are discrete, i.e.
   can be only one of a set of specific values. Examples of discrete
   parameters are inside colouring method or decomposition values and the
   way in which these are explored is different in that parameter zooming
   has no meaning for discrete parameters.

   When a discrete parameter is set to vary with x or y it is simply
   cycled through all possible values and round again. Words are getting
   clumsy so it's time for another example methinks!

   First press 'Insert' to restart Fractint and get everything back to its
   default values for a fresh start. Set the fractal type to 'fn*fn' this
   type requires the user to choose two trig functions and this choice is
   made on the 'Z' screen. There are around thirty different functions to
   choose from and checking out all the different combinations is a not
   inconsiderable task manually. With the explorer, however, it's a piece
   of cake!
