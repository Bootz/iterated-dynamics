  Toggle between Mandelbrot set images and their corresponding Julia-set
  images. Read the notes in Fractal Types, Julia Sets (p. 44) before
  trying this option if you want to see anything interesting.

  &lt;J&gt;
  Toggle between Julia escape time fractal and the Inverse Julia orbit
  fractal. See Inverse Julias (p. 46)

  &lt;Enter&gt;
  Enter is used to resume calculation after a pause. It is only necessary
  to do this when there is a message on the screen waiting to be
  acknowledged, such as the message shown after you save an image to disk.

  &lt;I&gt;
  Modify 3D transformation parameters used with 3D fractal types such as
  "Lorenz3D" and 3D "IFS" definitions, including the selection of "funny
  glasses" (p. 110) red/blue 3D.

  &lt;A&gt;
  Convert the current image into a fractal 'starfield'.  See Starfields
  (p. 97).

  &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;
  Unleash an image-eating ant automaton on current image. See Ant
  Automaton (p. 79).

  &lt;Ctrl-S&gt; (or &lt;k&gt;)
  Convert the current image into a Random Dot Stereogram (RDS).  See
  Random Dot Stereograms (RDS) (p. 102).

  &lt;O&gt; (the letter, not the number)
  If pressed while an image is being generated, toggles the display of
  intermediate results -- the "orbits" Fractint uses as it calculates
  values for each point. Slows the display a bit, but shows you how clever
  the program is behind the scenes. (See "A Little Code" in "Fractals and
  the PC" (p. 164).)

  &lt;D&gt;
  Shell to DOS. Return to Fractint by entering "exit" at a DOS prompt.

  &lt;Insert&gt;
  Restart at the "credits" screen and reset most variables to their
  initial state.  Variables which are not reset are: savename, lightname,
  video, startup filename.

  &lt;L&gt;
  Enter Browsing Mode.  See Browse Commands (p. 37).

  &lt;Ctrl-E&gt;
  Enter Explorer/Evolver Mode.  See Evolver Commands (p. 38).
