  The second parameter to diffusion changes the type of growth.  If you
  set it to 1, then the diffusion will start with a line along the bottom
  of the screen.  Points will appear above this line and the fractal will
  grow upward.  For this fractal, the points are restricted to a box which
  is as wide as the screen but whose distance from the fractal is given by
  the border size (the first parameter).  Initial points are released from
  a centered segment along the top of this box which has a width equal to
  twice the border size.

  If the second parameter is set to 2, then diffusion begins with a square
  box on the screen.  Points appear on a circle inside the box whose
  distance from the box is equal to the border size.  This fractal grows
  very slowly since the points are not restricted to a small box.

  The third and last parameter for diffusion controls the color of the
  fractal.  If it is set to zero then points are colored randomly.
  Otherwise, it tells how often to shift the color of the points being
  deposited.  If you set it to 150, for example, then the color of the
  points will shift every 150 points leading to a radial color pattern if
  you are using the standards diffusion type.

  Diffusion was inspired by a Scientific American article a couple of
  years back which includes actual pictures of real physical phenomena
  that behave like this.

  Thanks to Adrian Mariano for providing the diffusion code and
  documentation. Juan J. Buhler added additional options.


 2.38 Magnetic Fractals

  (type=magnet1m/.../magnet2j)

  These fractals use formulae derived from the study of hierarchical
  lattices, in the context of magnetic renormalisation transformations.
  This kinda stuff is useful in an area of theoretical physics that deals
  with magnetic phase-transitions (predicting at which temperatures a
  given substance will be magnetic, or non-magnetic).  In an attempt to
  clarify the results obtained for Real temperatures (the kind that you
  and I can feel), the study moved into the realm of Complex Numbers,
  aiming to spot Real phase-transitions by finding the intersections of
  lines representing Complex phase-transitions with the Real Axis.  The
  first people to try this were two physicists called Yang and Lee, who
  found the situation a bit more complex than first expected, as the phase
  boundaries for Complex temperatures are (surprise!) fractals.

  And that's all the technical (?) background you're getting here!  For
  more details (are you SERIOUS ?!) read "The Beauty of Fractals".  When
  you understand it all, you might like to rewrite this section, before
  you start your new job as a professor of theoretical physics...

  In Fractint terms, the important bits of the above are "Fractals",
  "Complex Numbers", "Formulae", and "The Beauty of Fractals".  Lifting
  the Formulae straight out of the Book and iterating them over the
  Complex plane (just like the Mandelbrot set) produces Fractals.
