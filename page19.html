  &lt;M&gt; or &lt;Esc&gt;
  Return from a displayed image to the main menu.

  &lt;Esc&gt;
  From the main menu, &lt;Esc&gt; is used to exit from Fractint.

  &lt;Delete&gt;
  Same as choosing "select video mode" from the main menu.  Goes to the
  "select video mode" screen.  See Video Mode Function Keys (p. 36).

  &lt;h&gt;
  Redraw the previous image in the circular history buffer, revisiting
  fractals you previously generated this session in reverse order.
  Fractint saves the last ten images worth of information including
  fractal type, coordinates, colors, and all options. Image information is
  saved only when some item changes. After ten images the circular buffer
  wraps around and earlier information is overwritten. You can set image
  capacity of the history feature using the maxhistory=&lt;nnn&gt; command.
  About 1200 bytes of memory is required for each image slot.

  &lt;Ctrl-h&gt;
  Redraw the next image in the circular history buffer. Use this to return
  to images you passed by when using &lt;h&gt;.

  &lt;Tab&gt;
  Display the current fractal type, parameters, video mode, screen or (if
  displayed) zoom-box coordinates, maximum iteration count, and other
  information useful in keeping track of where you are.  The Tab function
  is non-destructive - if you press it while in the midst of generating an
  image, you will continue generating it when you return.  The Tab
  function tells you if your image is still being generated or has
  finished - a handy feature for those overnight, 1024x768 resolution
  fractal images.  If the image is incomplete, it also tells you whether
  it can be interrupted and resumed.  (Any function other than &lt;Tab&gt; and
  &lt;F1&gt; counts as an "interrupt".)

  The Tab screen also includes a pixel-counting function, which will count
  the number of pixels colored in the inside color.  This gives an
  estimate of the area of the fractal.  Note that the inside color must be
  different from the outside color(s) for this to work; inside=0 is a good
  choice.

  &lt;T&gt;
  Select a fractal type. Move the cursor to your choice (or type the first
  few letters of its name) and hit &lt;Enter&gt;. Next you will be prompted for
  any parameters used by the selected type - hit &lt;Enter&gt; for the defaults.
  See Fractal Types (p. 43) for a list of supported types.

  &lt;F&gt;
  Toggles the use of floating-point algorithms (see "Limitations of
  Integer Math (And How We Cope)" (p. 166)).  Whether floating point is in
  use is shown on the &lt;Tab&gt; status screen.  The floating point option can
  also be turned on and off using the "X" options screen.  If you have a
  non-Intel floating point chip which supports the full 387 instruction
  set, see the "FPU=" command in Startup Parameters (p. 122) to get the
  most out of your chip.
