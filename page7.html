    orbits for each pixel.  See Drawing Method (p. 86).

  Xfractint fixes: Fixed the newton and newtbasin types in Xfractint so
    they would work without using the FPU=387 option.

    Fixed the Xfractint mandelbrot code in calmanfp.c so that the image
    generated matched the one produced by the StandardFractal() routine.

    Fixed the outside=sum option when used with the mandel fractal type.

    Fixed the command line option -geometry, which broke at 20.2.05.

  Patch 2 to Version 20.3.0
  Fixed the inability to reload a PAR created from an arbitrary precision
    fractal with a large magnification.

    Fixed the problem with a left mouse click not bringing up the zoom box
    after an image is completed.

    Incorporated Gerald Dobiasovsky's fix for the julibrot type when used
    with quat and hypercomplex.

    Fixed the display of subdirectories in Xfractint.

    Replaced control characters in realdos.c with the equivalent ascii
    values to quiet complaints by CVS.

  Patch 1
  Fixed the float bailout for the lambdafn fractal type when the EXP
    function is used so the float and integer images match.

    Jan Andres contributed Xfractint fixes that allow compiling with newer
    versions of gcc because varargs.h is no longer supported.  Enabled the
    use of the long double type on Solaris.  Moved the getwd() macro
    definition in prompts1.c after the #include lines, to avoid the mess
    that happens when the prototype for getwd() is included but it's
    already defined as a macro.  Added some Solaris-specific comments to
    the Makefile.

    Fixed the sound in Xfractint so the beep turns off now.

    Changed lsys.c to use inline1 instead of the reserved word inline.

  Version 20.3.0
  Incremented the version number to accommodate backwards compatibility
    for the inside=atan and outside=atan options.

    Fixed inside=atan and outside=atan to use the full color palette
    instead of limiting to 180 colors.

    Added Charlie Chernohorsky's virtual screen zoombox fix.  See View
    Window (p. 34).

    Added Gerald Dobiasovsky's fixes for the demo key files needed because
    of menu prompt changes and pan/zoom size changes.
