    formula parser and multiple parameters are used.  Each parameter is
    now checked.

  Patch 12
  Fixed a 3D error introduced with patch 11.  Fixed the stereogram screen
    prompts to prevent out of bounds array accesses.

  Patch 11
  Fixed an off by one error in the Xfractint type=julia code.  Fixed the
    case where the second image would not finish generating when the 3D
    parameter Stereo=photo or stereo pair was used with an orbit type such
    as Lorenz.

  Patch 10
  Fixed some user interface prompts that were wrong in Xfractint. Merged
    the Xfractint version system with Fractint's. Thanks to Scott Boyd for
    these changes.

  Patch 9
  Fixed a bug that occurred when maxhistory=0 was used.  Fixed a bug that
    occurred when ismand was used in a formula and ctrl &lt;o&gt; was pressed.

  Patch 8
  Fixed a bug causing a lock up with lsystem and ifs fractal types when
    using a disk video mode with an X or Y resolution greater than 2048.

  Patch 7
  Updated Xfractint, copyright notice.

  Patch 6
  Fixed fractint.cfg problems with extra commas or long lines. This allows
    the output of makefcfg from certain video boards to be used without
    editing.

  Added center, magxmag, and rotskew constants to parser. See Center-Mag
    Predefined Variables (p. 66)

  Patch 5
  Added new command truemode=iter, which is used to switch the ouput to
    the truecolor Targa file to the number of iterates for each pixel.

  Made selecting the evolver feature turn off truecolor=yes.  Each
    subimage was being generated as a separate blank Targa file.

  Patch 4
  Fixed the type=test bug.

  Patch 3
  Fixed a bug in the pentium mandelbrot code that affected periodicity
    checking.  Fixed a problem with skewed zoom boxes leaving dots on the
    screen.  This also fixed browser boxes with the same problem.  Fixed
    the zoom box so it is visible in 2-color modes.

  Patch 2
  Fixed a bug in the formula parser.
