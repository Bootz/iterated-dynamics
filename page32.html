    you are using a 256 color mode with maxiter 150, and have used the
    palette editor to set all 256 possible colors for use with color
    cycling, then you'll want to set the "# of colors" to 256.

    See the Recordcolors (p. 128) command, which controls when mapfiles
    are used and when compressed colors are written to PAR files.

    maxlinelength: This number controls the maximum width of a parameter
    entry in a PAR file. The default is 72 characters.

    At the bottom of the input screen are inputs for Fractint's "pieces"
    divide-and-conquer feature. You can create multiple PAR entries that
    break an image up into pieces so that you can generate the image
    pieces one by one. There are two reasons for doing this. The first is
    in case the fractal is very slow, and you want to generate parts of
    the image at the same time on several computers. The second is that
    you might want to make an image greater than 2048 x 2048, the old
    pixel limit for Fractint. The parameters for this feature are:
       X Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the x direction
       Y Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the y direction
       Video mode  - Fractint video mode for each piece (e.g. "F3")

    The last item defaults to the current video mode. If either X
    Multiples or Y Multiples are greater than 1, then multiple numbered
    PAR entries for the pieces are added to the PAR file, and a
    MAKEMIG.BAT file is created that builds all of the component pieces
    and then stitches them together into a "multi-image" GIF.  The current
    limitations of the "divide and conquer" algorithm are 36 or fewer X
    and Y multiples (so you are limited to "only" 36x36=1296 component
    images), and a final resolution limit in both the X and Y directions
    of 65,535 (a limitation of "only" four billion pixels or so).

    The final image generated by MAKEMIG is a "multi-image" GIF file
    called FRACTMIG.GIF.  In case you have other software that can't
    handle multi-image GIF files, MAKEMIG includes a final (but commented
    out) call to SIMPLGIF, a companion program that reads a GIF file that
    may contain little tricks like multiple images and creates a simple
    GIF from it.  Fair warning: SIMPLGIF needs room to build a composite
    image while it works, and it does that using a temporary disk file
    equal to the size of the final image - and a 64Kx64K GIF image
    requires a 4GB temporary disk file!

  &lt;G&gt;

  The &lt;G&gt; command lets you give a startup parameter interactively.


 1.9 "3D" Commands

  See "3D" Images (p. 106) for details of these commands.

  &lt;3&gt;
  Restore a saved image as a 3D "landscape", translating its color
  information into "height". You will be prompted for all KINDS of
  options.
