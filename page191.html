     y = (imag(c) + imag(d))/2
     z = (imag(c) - imag(d))/2
     w = (real(d) - real(c))/2
  We can now, for example, compute sin(h). First compute the two complex
  numbers a and b as above, then set c = sin(a) and d = sin(b) where sin()
  is the complex version of the sin function. Now use the equations above
  to solve for x, y, z, and w in terms of c and d. The hypercomplex number
  (x,y,z,w) thus obtained is sin(h).

  The beauty of this is that it really doesn't make any difference what
  function we use. Instead of sin, we could have used cos, sinh, ln, or
  z^2.  Using this technique, Fractint can create 3-D fractals using the
  formula h' = fn(h) + c, where "fn" is any of the built-in functions.
  Where fn is sqr(), this is the famous mandelbrot formula, generalized to
  four dimensions.
