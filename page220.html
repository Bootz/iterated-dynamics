  Parameters shown in &lt;z&gt; screen now match those used in a formula.

  Distance estimator logic has been overhauled, with the variable
    olddemmcolors added for backward compatibility.

  New floating point code for Lsystems from Nick Wilt greatly speeds up
     image generation.

  Enhanced fast parser from Chuck Ebbert makes floating point formula
    fractals faster than built-in types.

  Enhanced the history command to include all parameters, colors, and even
    .frm, .l, and .ifs file names and entries. Number of history sets
    remembered can be set with the maxhistory=&lt;nnn&gt; command to save
    memory.

  Enhanced center-mag coordinates to support rotated/stretched/skewed zoom
    boxes.

  Added new parameter to built-in Halley for comparison with formula type,
    also added new parameter to Frothybasin type.

  Added color number to orbits numbers &lt;n&gt; display.

  Added two new parameters to distest= to allow specifying resolution.
    This allows making resolution-independent distance estimator images.

  Fixed bug that caused the "big red switch" bug if '(' appeared in random
    uncommented formula file text, but fair warning, we don't officially
    support uncommented text in FRM files.

  Symmetry now works for the Marksjulia type and Marksmandel types.

  Full path no longer written in PAR files with &lt;b&gt; command.

  Fixed fractal type fn(z*z) so that zooming out will no longer dump you
    out to DOS, affecting zoomed out integer images made with this type.

  Fixed a float to fudged integer conversion that affects integer fractal
    types fn(z*z) and fn*fn.  This has only a minor impact on integer
    images made with these types.

  Default drive and directory restored after dropping to DOS, in case you
    changed it while under DOS.

  Added support for inversion to the formula parser (type=formula).

  Increased maximum number of files listed by &lt;r&gt; command to 2977 from
  300.

  Added outside=atan option.

  Added faster auto logmap logic.
