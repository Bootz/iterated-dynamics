  COLORS=@filename tells Fractint to use a color map file named
  "filename".  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  COLORS=colorspecification specifies the colors directly. The value of
  "colorspecification" is rather long (768 characters for 256 color
  modes), and its syntax is not documented here.  This form of the COLORS=
  command is not intended for manual use - it exists for use by the &lt;B&gt;
  command when saving the description of a nice image.

  RECORDCOLORS=auto|comment|yes
  Controls the method of writing colors in PAR files. Auto causes the
  colors to be written in the colors=@mapfile form if the colors were
  loaded from a map. Use this mode if you manage your colors using map
  files. If you share PAR files with others, and have trouble remembering
  to send them the map file, use RECORDCOLORS=comment or yes. These modes
  force the writing of compressed color maps in the PAR file in all cases.
  The only difference is that the 'comment' option also writes the mapfile
  name in a comment so you can remember where the colors came from.

  CYCLERANGE=nnn/nnn
  Sets the range of color numbers to be animated during color cycling.
  The default is 1/255, i.e. just color number 0 (usually black) is not
  cycled.

  CYCLELIMIT=nnn
  Sets the speed of color cycling. Technically, the number of DAC
  registers updated during a single vertical refresh cycle. Legal values
  are 1 - 256, default is 55.

  TEXTCOLORS=mono
  Set text screen colors to simple black and white.

  TEXTCOLORS=aa/bb/cc/...
  Set text screen colors. Omit any value to use the default (e.g.
  textcolors=////50 to set just the 5th value). Each value is a 2 digit
  hexadecimal value; 1st digit is background color (from 0 to 7), 2nd
  digit is foreground color (from 0 to F).
  Color values are:
      0 black     8 gray
      1 blue      9 light blue
      2 green     A light green
      3 cyan      B light cyan
      4 red       C light red
      5 magenta   D light magenta
      6 brown     E yellow
      7 white     F bright white

  31 colors can be specified, their meanings are as follows:
    heading:
      1  Fractint version info
      2  heading line development info (not used in released version)
    help:
      3  sub-heading
      4  main text
      5  instructions at bottom of screen
      6  hotlink field
