  (The remainder of this "new features" section is from version 18.0)

  New fractal types:

   19 new fractal types, including:

   New fractal types - 'lambda(fn||fn)', 'julia(fn||fn)',
   'manlam(fn||fn)', 'mandel(fn||fn)', 'halley', 'phoenix', 'mandphoenix',
   'cellular', generalized bifurcation, and 'bifmay' - from Jonathan
   Osuch.

   New Mandelcloud, Quaternion, Dynamic System, Cellular Automata fractal
   types from Ken Shirriff.

   New HyperComplex fractal types from Timothy Wegner

   New ICON type from Dan Farmer, including a PAR file of examples.

   New Frothy Basin fractal types (and PAR entries) by Wesley Loewer

   MIIM (Modified Inverse Iteration Method) implementation of Inverse
   Julia from Michael Snyder.

   New Inverse Julia fractal type from Juan Buhler.

   New floating-point versions of Markslambda, Marksmandel, Mandel4, and
   Julia4 types (chosen automatically if the floating-point option is
   enabled).

  New options/features:

   New assembler-based parser logic from Chuck Ebbert - significantly
   faster than the C-based code it replaces!

   New assembler-based Lyapunov logic from Nicholas Wilt and Wes Loewer.
   Roughly six times faster than the old version!

   New Orbits-on-a-window / Julia-in-a-window options:
    1) The old Overlay option is now '#' (Shift-3).
    2) During generation, 'O' brings up orbits (as before) - after
       generation, 'O' brings up new orbits Windows mode.
    3) Control-O brings up new orbits Windows mode at any time.
    4) Spacebar toggles between Inverse Julia mode and the Julia set and
       back to the Mandelbrot set.
   These new "in-a-window" modes are really neat!  See Orbits Window
   (p. 34) and Julia Toggle Spacebar Commands (p. 45) for details.

   New multi-image GIF support in the &lt;B&gt; command.  You can now generate
   65535x65535x256 fractal images using Fractint (if you have the disk
   space, of course).  This option builds special PAR entries and a
   MAKEMIG.BAT file that you later use to invoke Fractint multiple times
   to generate individual sections of the image and (in a final step)
   stitch them all together.  If your other software can't handle
   Multiple-image GIFs, a SIMPLGIF program is also supplied that converts
   MIGS into simgle-image GIFs.  Press F1 at the &lt;B&gt; prompts screen for
   details.
