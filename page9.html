    Fixed the PAGE-UP/PAGE-DN zoombox in Xfractint so that it now appears
    on the screen.  Fixed ranges= in Xfractint so GIFs save correctly and
    program doesn't end abruptly.

  Patch 4
  Modified the Xfractint makefile and source files to allow compiling
    without an assembler.

  Patch 3
  This patch ran the Xfractint code through -Wall to clear up most of the
    warnings.  Updated the Xfractint man page.  Turned on compiler
    optimizations.

    Fixed the documentation for the Latoocarfian fractal type thanks to
    comments by Pierre Desjardins on the Fractint Bug List.

  Patch 2
  This patch adds the assembly language version of the mandelbrot code to
    Xfractint.  To use it, it is necessary to place the command line
    switch fpu=387 in your sstools.ini file.  The NASM assembler was used,
    but if you don't have it available, not to worry, the object file is
    included.

    Modified the Xfractint C mandelbrot code to match the assembly
    version.

  Patch 1
  Made a small change to the quickcalc logic used to recalculate the
    inside pixels only when the iteration count is increased with a
    completed image.  Interrupting and resuming the calculation was
    leaving extra pixels on the screen.

    Patched the Xfractint fractint.h file to match the DOS version.

    Fixed an Xfractint problem with color depths greater than 16 bits per
    pixel.

  Version 20.2.0
  Incremented the version number to accommodate backwards compatibility
    for the logmap option.

    Modified the logmap routine so that the color with index # 2 would be
    displayed.

    Added a logmode=auto command line option that causes the logmap to
    adjust automatically when zooming.  Changing almost anything will turn
    this feature off.  It is best set using the &lt;g&gt; screen prompt.

    Edited the help docs to document the move of the development area from
    Compuserve to the web.

  Patch 13
  Added parameters p4 and p5 to the evolver.  This required splitting the
    tweak central screen into two pages.
