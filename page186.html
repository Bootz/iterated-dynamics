  representing all the points that are "attracted" to Infinity at the same
  "rate".  These sets (bands of color) are termed "Level Sets" - all
  points in such a set are at the same "Level" away from the attractor, in
  terms of numbers of iterations required to exceed the bailout value.

  Thus, Fractint produces colored images of the Level Sets of the Basin of
  Attraction of Infinity, for all fractals that iterate functions of
  Complex numbers, at least.  Now we have a sound mathematical definition
  of what Fractint's "bailout" processing generates, and we have formally
  introduced the terms Attractor, Basin of Attraction, and Level Set, so
  you should have little trouble following the rest of this section!

  For certain Julia-type fractals, Fractint can also display the Level
  Sets of Basins of Attraction of Finite Attractors.  This capability is a
  by-product of the implementation of the MAGNETic fractal types, which
  always have at least one Finite Attractor.

  This option can be invoked by setting the "Look for finite attractor"
  option on the &lt;Y&gt; options screen, or by giving the "finattract=yes"
  command-line option.

  Most Julia-types that have a "lake" (normally colored blue by default)
  have a Finite Attractor within this lake, and the lake turns out to be,
  quite appropriately, the Basin of Attraction of this Attractor.

  The "finattract=yes" option (command-line or &lt;Y&gt; options screen)
  instructs Fractint to seek out and identify a possible Finite Attractor
  and, if found, to display the Level Sets of its Basin of Attraction, in
  addition to those of the Basin of Attraction of Infinity.  In many cases
  this results in a "lake" with colored "waves" in it;  in other cases
  there may be little change in the lake's appearance.

  For a quick demonstration, select a fractal type of LAMBDA, with a
  parameter of 0.5 + 0.5i.  You will obtain an image with a large blue
  lake.  Now set "Look for finite attractor" to 1 with the "Y" menu.  The
  image will be re-drawn with a much more colorful lake.  A Finite
  Attractor lives in the center of one of the resulting "ripple" patterns
  in the lake - turn the &lt;O&gt;rbits display on to see where it is - the
  orbits of all initial points that are in the lake converge there.

  Fractint tests for the presence of a Finite Attractor by iterating a
  Critical Value of the fractal's function.  If the iteration doesn't bail
  out before exceeding twice the iteration limit, it is almost certain
  that we have a Finite Attractor - we assume that we have.

  Next we define a small circle around it and, after each iteration, as
  well as testing for the usual bailout value being exceeded, we test to
  see if we've hit the circle. If so, we bail out and color our pixels
  according to the number of iterations performed.  Result - a nicely
  colored-in lake that displays the Level Sets of the Basin of Attraction
  of the Finite Attractor.  Sometimes !

  First exception: This does not work for the lakes of Mandel-types.
  Every point in a Mandel-type is, in effect, a single point plucked from
  one of its related Julia-types.  A Mandel-type's lake has an infinite
  number of points, and thus an infinite number of related Julia-type
