  Inverting through a circle not centered on the origin produces bizarre
  effects that we're not even going to try to describe. Aren't computers
  wonderful?


 3.6 Decomposition

  You'll remember that most fractal types are calculated by iterating a
  simple function of a complex number, producing another complex number,
  until either the number exceeds some pre-defined "bailout" value, or the
  iteration limit is reached. The pixel corresponding to the starting
  point is then colored based on the result of that calculation.

  The decomposition option ("decomp=", on the &lt;X&gt; screen) toggles to
  another coloring protocol.  Here the points are colored according to
  which quadrant of the complex plane (negative real/positive imaginary,
  positive real/positive imaginary, etc.) the final value is in. If you
  use 4 as the parameter, points ending up in each quadrant are given
  their own color; if 2 (binary decomposition), points in alternating
  quadrants are given 2 alternating colors.

  The result is a kind of warped checkerboard coloring, even in areas that
  would ordinarily be part of a single contour. Remember, for the M-set
  all points whose final values exceed 2 (by any amount) after, say, 80
  iterations are normally the same color; under decomposition, Fractint
  runs [bailout-value] iterations and then colors according to where the
  actual final value falls on the complex plane.

  When using decomposition, a higher bailout value will give a more
  accurate plot, at some expense in speed.  You might want to set the
  bailout value (in the parameters prompt following selection of a new
  fractal type; present for most but not all types) to a higher value than
  the default.  A value of about 50 is a good compromise for M/J sets.


 3.7 Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges

  By default, Fractint maps iterations to colors 1:1. I.e. if the
  calculation for a fractal "escapes" (exceeds the bailout value) after N
  iterations, the pixel is colored as color number N. If N is greater than
  the number of colors available, it wraps around. So, if you are using a
  16-color video mode, and you are using the default maximum iteration
  count of 150, your image will run through the 16-color palette 150/16 =
  9.375 times.

  When you use Logarithmic palettes, the entire range of iteration values
  is compressed to map to one span of the color range.  This results in
  spectacularly different images if you are using a high iteration limit
  and are zooming in on an area near a "lakelet".

  When using a compressed palette in a 256 color mode, we suggest changing
  your colors from the usual defaults.  The last few colors in the default
  IBM VGA color map are black.  This results in points nearest the "lake"
  smearing into a single dark band, with little contrast from the blue (by
  default) lake.
