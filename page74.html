  An Example.  I like sonnets.  A sonnet is a poem with fourteen lines
  that has the following rhyming sequence: abba abba abab cc.  Ignoring
  the rhyming couplet at the end, let's calculate the Order parameter for
  this pattern.

    abbaabbaabab         doesn't start with at least 2 a's
    aabbaabababb         rotate it
    1001101010           drop the first and last, replace with 0's and 1's

    512+64+32+8+2 = 618

  An Order parameter of 618 gives the Lyapunov equivalent of a sonnet.
  "How do I make thee? Let me count the ways..."

  Population Seed.  When two parts of a Lyapunov overlap, which spike
  overlaps which is strongly dependent on the initial value of the
  population model.  Any changes from using a different starting value
  between 0 and 1 may be subtle. The values 0 and 1 are interpreted in a
  special manner. A Seed of 1 will choose a random number between 0 and 1
  at the start of each pixel. A Seed of 0 will suppress resetting the seed
  value between pixels unless the population model diverges in which case
  a random seed will be used on the next pixel.

  Filter Cycles.  Like the Bifurcation model, the Lyapunov allow you to
  set the number of cycles that will be run to allow the model to approach
  equilibrium before the lyapunov exponent calculation is begun. The
  default value of 0 uses one half of the iterations before beginning the
  calculation of the exponent.

 2.41 fn||fn Fractals

  (type=lambda(fn||fn), manlam(fn||fn), julia(fn||fn), mandel(fn||fn))

  Two functions=[sin|cos|sinh|cosh|exp|log|sqr|...]) are specified with
  these types.  The two functions are alternately used in the calculation
  based on a comparison between the modulus of the current Z and the shift
  value.  The first function is used if the modulus of Z is less than the
  shift value and the second function is used otherwise.

  The lambda(fn||fn) type calculates the Julia set of the formula
  lambda*fn(Z), for various values of the function "fn", where lambda and
  Z are both complex.  Two values, the real and imaginary parts of lambda,
  should be given in the "params=" option.  The third value is the shift
  value.  The space bar will generate the corresponding "pseudo
  Mandelbrot" set, manlam(fn||fn).

  The manlam(fn||fn) type calculates the "pseudo Mandelbrot" set of the
  formula fn(Z)*C, for various values of the function "fn", where C and Z
  are both complex.  Two values, the real and imaginary parts of Z(0),
  should be given in the "params=" option.  The third value is the shift
  value.  The space bar will generate the corresponding julia set,
  lamda(fn||fn).
