  Plus we give you 4 parameters to set, the complex coefficients of the
  two functions!  Thus the innocent-looking "fn+fn" type is really 729
  different types in disguise, not counting the damage done by the
  parameters!

  Lee informs us that you should not judge fractals by their "outer"
  appearance. For example, the images produced by z = sin(z) + z^2 and z =
  sin(z) - z^2 look very similar, but are different when you zoom in.


 2.24 Kam Torus

  (type=kamtorus, kamtorus3d)

  This type is created by superimposing orbits generated by a set of
  equations, with a variable incremented each time.

           x(0) = y(0) = orbit/3;
           x(n+1) = x(n)*cos(a) + (x(n)*x(n)-y(n))*sin(a)
           y(n+1) = x(n)*sin(a) - (x(n)*x(n)-y(n))*cos(a)

  After each orbit, 'orbit' is incremented by a step size. The parameters
  are angle "a", step size for incrementing 'orbit', stop value for
  'orbit', and points per orbit. Try this with a stop value of 5 with
  sound=x for some weird fractal music (ok, ok, fractal noise)! You will
  also see the KAM Torus head into some chaotic territory that Scott
  Taylor wanted to hide from you by setting the defaults the way he did,
  but now we have revealed all!

  The 3D variant is created by treating 'orbit' as the z coordinate.

  With both variants, you can adjust the "maxiter" value (&lt;X&gt; options
  screen or parameter maxiter=) to change the number of orbits plotted.


 2.25 Bifurcation

  (type=bifxxx)

  The wonder of fractal geometry is that such complex forms can arise from
  such simple generating processes. A parallel surprise has emerged in the
  study of dynamical systems: that simple, deterministic equations can
  yield chaotic behavior, in which the system never settles down to a
  steady state or even a periodic loop. Often such systems behave normally
  up to a certain level of some controlling parameter, then go through a
  transition in which there are two possible solutions, then four, and
  finally a chaotic array of possibilities.

  This emerged many years ago in biological models of population growth.
  Consider a (highly over-simplified) model in which the rate of growth is
  partly a function of the size of the current population:

  New Population =  Growth Rate * Old Population * (1 - Old Population)
