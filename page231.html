    "filename=.xxx" can be used to set default &lt;r&gt; function file mask

    Selection of type formula or lsys now goes directly to entry selection
      (file selection step is now skipped); to change to a different file,
      use &lt;F6&gt; from the entry selection screen

    Three new values have been added to the textcolors= parameter; if you
      use this parameter you should update it by inserting values for the
      new 6th, 7th, 9th, and 13th positions; see "textcolors=" in Color
      Parameters (p. 128)

    The formula type's imag() function has changed to return the result as
      a real number

    Fractal type-specific parameters (entered after selecting a new
      fractal type with &lt;T&gt;) now restart at their default values each time
      you select a new fractal type

    Floating point input fields can now be entered in scientific notation
      (e.g.  11.234e-20). Entering the letters "e" and "p" in the first
      column causes the numbers e=2.71828... and pi=3.14159... to be
      entered.

    New option "orbitsave=yes" to create files for Acrospin for some types
      (see Barnsley IFS Fractals (p. 53), Orbit Fractals (p. 60),
      Acrospin (p. 203))

    Bug fixes:
      Problem with Hercules adapter auto-detection repaired.
      Problems with VESA video adapters repaired (we're not sure we've got
        them all yet...)
      3D transforms fixed to work at high resolutions (&gt; 1000 dots).
      3D parameters no longer clobbered when restoring non-3D images.
      L-Systems fixed to not crash when order too high for available
      memory.
      PostScript EPS file fixes.
      Bad leftmost pixels with floating point at 2048 dot resolution
      fixed.
      3D transforms fixed to use current &lt;x&gt; screen float/integer setting.
      Restore of images using inversion fixed.
      Error in "cos" function (used with "fn" type fractals) fixed; prior
        incorrect function still available as "cosxx" for compatibility

    Old 3D=nn/nn/nn/... form of 3D transform parameters no longer
    supported

    Fractint source code now Microsoft C6.00A compatible.

  Version 15.11, 3/91, companion to Fractal Creations, not for general
  release

    Autokey feature, IIT fpu support, and some bug fixes publicly released
    in version 16.
