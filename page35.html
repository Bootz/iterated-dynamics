  "Reduction factor"
  When an explicit size is not given, this determines the view window
  size, as a factor of the screen size.  E.g. a reduction factor of 2
  makes the window 1/2 as big as the screen in both dimensions.

  "Final media aspect ratio"
  This is the height of the final image you want, divided by the width.
  The default is 0.75 because standard PC monitors have a height:width
  ratio of 3:4. E.g. set this to 2.0 for an image twice as high as it is
  wide. The effect of this parameter is visible only when "preview
  display" is enabled.  If the explicit size of both x and y are set,
  setting this value to 0 will cause the appropriate value to be
  calculated based on x and y.

  "Crop starting coordinates"
  This parameter affects what happens when you change the aspect ratio. If
  set to "no", then when you change aspect ratio, the prior image will be
  squeezed or stretched to fit into the new shape. If set to "yes", the
  prior image is "cropped" to avoid squeezing or stretching.

  "Explicit size"
  Setting these to non-zero values over-rides the "reduction factor" with
  explicit sizes in pixels. If only the "x pixels" size is specified, the
  "y pixels" size is calculated automatically based on x and the aspect
  ratio.

  The following option is available when using disk video or virtual
  screen modes:

  "Virtual screen"
  Setting these allow defining a virtual screen as large as the available
  video memory will permit.

  The following options are available when using virtual screen modes:

  "Keep aspect"
  If this is set, when the asked for virtual screen is larger than video
  memory the X and Y values will both be reduced such that the ratio
  between them is maintained.  If not set, just the Y value will be
  reduced.

  "Zoombox scrolling"
  The fixed setting tries to maintain the zoombox in the center of the
  screen by moving the virtual image.  The relaxed setting moves the
  virtual image when the zoombox reached the edges of the screen.

  More about final aspect ratio:  If you want to produce a high quality
  hard-copy image which is say 8" high by 5" down, based on a vertical
  "slice" of an existing image, you could use a procedure like the
  following. You'll need some method of converting a GIF image to your
  final media (slide or whatever) - Fractint can only do the whole job
  with a PostScript printer, it does not preserve aspect ratio with other
  printers.
