     Run the following .key file with command line parameters
     fastrestore=yes and askvideo=no (and, if you don't set your video
     mode in sstools.ini, video=[your standard video mode]) and your
     coworkers will get a continuous display of the .gif files in your
     default .gif directory when you go to lunch (come on, we know you
     have Fractint on your hard drive at work):

           "r"
            MORE:
            ENTER
            CALCWAIT
            WAIT 30
            "R"
            CTRL_RIGHT
            GOTO MORE

  Added four new lsystem types to fractint.l.

  When palette editing mode is entered, the original palette is now stored
    in the area associated with F2.

  Reduced the fractint.cfg resolution limit to 2x2 pixels.

  Fixed bug which caused a lockup when ranges= was used with maxit &gt;=
  32767.

  Fixed arbitrary precision and decoder crashes.

  Fixed an entry display scrolling bug.

  Fixed the integer mode frothy basin "censored" bug.

  Added backwards compatibility for inside=startrails.

  Fixed the 16-color color cycling inside the palette editor.  Fixed color
    cycling when used with a maxit &gt; 32767.  Pixels with iterations &gt;
    32767 now cycle in the same direction as those with iterations &lt;=
    32767.

  Fixed bug which caused an apparent lockup when find finite attractor was
    used with maxit &gt; 32767.

  Fixed viewwindows bug that caused extra points to be written when ydots
    was not divisible by 4.

  Fixed Ant type so that it works with 16 digits.  Old pars will need to
    be re-entered or have a decimal point added to the first two
    parameters.

  Changed MAXSTRING in the decoder from 64000 to 60000. This change
    eliminates all the encoder bug examples we have, but we don't
    understand why it works and we may not have fixed the problem.

  Fixed the logmap routine when used with a par/gif release &lt;= 1920 and
    memory for the LogTable is insufficient.
