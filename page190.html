  Quaternions are not the only possible four dimensional supersets of the
  complex numbers. William Rowan Hamilton, who discovered quaternions in
  1843, considered the alternative called the hypercomplex number system.
  Unlike quaternions, the hypercomplex numbers satisfy the commutative law
  of multiplication. The law which fails is the field property that states
  that all non-zero elements of a field have a multiplicative inverse. For
  a non-zero hypercomplex number h, the multiplicative inverse 1/h does
  not always exist.

  As with quaternions, we will define multiplication in terms of the basis
  vectors 1, i, j, and k, but with subtly different rules.

  Multiplication rules for hypercomplex basis vectors:
  ij = k  jk = -i ki = -j
  ji = k  kj = -i ik = -j
  ii = jj = -kk = -1
  ijk = 1

  Note that now ij = k and ji = k, and similarly for other products of pairs
  of basis vectors, so the commutative law holds.

  Hypercomplex multiplication formula:
  Let h1 = x1 + y1i + z1j + w1k and h2 = x2 + y2i + z2j + w2k.
  Then  h1h2 =  1(x1x2 - y1y2 - z1z2 + w1w2) +
                i(y1x2 + x1y2 - w1z2 - z1w2) +
                j(z1x2 - w1y2 + x1z2 - y1w2) +
                k(w1x2 + z1y2 + y1z2 + x1w2)

  As an added bonus, we'll give you the formula for the reciprocal.

  Let det = [((x-w)^2+(y+z)^2)((x+w)^2+(y-z)^2)]
  Then 1/h =   1[ x(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)-2w(xw-yz)]/det +
               i[-y(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)-2z(xw-yz)]/det +
               j[-z(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)-2y(xw-yz)]/det +
               k[ w(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)-2x(xw-yz)]/det

  A look at this formula shows the difficulty with hypercomplex numbers.
  In order to calculate 1/h, you have to divide by the quantity det =
  [((x-w)^2+(y+z)^2)((x+w)^2+(y-z)^2)]. So when this quantity is zero, the
  multiplicative inverse will not exist.

  Hypercomplex numbers have an elegant generalization of any unary complex
  valued function defined on the complex numbers. First, note that
  hypercomplex numbers can be represented as a pair of complex numbers in
  the following way.
  Let h = x + yi + zj + wk.
      a = (x-w) + i(y+z)
      b = (x+w) + i(y-z)
  The numbers a and b are complex numbers. We can represent h as the pair
  of complex numbers (a,b). Conversely, if we have a hypercomplex number
  given to us in the form (a,b), we can solve for x, y, z, and w. The
  solution to
     c = (x-w) + i(y+z)
     d = (x+w) + i(y-z)
  is
     x = (real(c) + real(d))/2
