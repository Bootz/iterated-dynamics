  A truly wild variation of 3D may be seen by entering "2" for the stereo
  mode (see "Stereo 3D Viewing" (p. 110)), putting on red/blue "funny
  glasses", and watching the fern develop with full depth perception right
  there before your eyes!

  This feature USED to be dedicated to Bruce Goren, as a bribe to get him
  to send us MORE knockout stereo slides of 3D ferns, now that we have
  made it so easy! Bruce, what have you done for us *LATELY* ?? (Just
  kidding, really!)

  Each line in an IFS definition (look at FRACTINT.IFS with your editor
  for examples) contains the parameters for one of the generating
  functions, e.g. in FERN:
     a    b     c    d    e    f    p
   ___________________________________
     0     0    0  .16    0    0   .01
   .85   .04 -.04  .85    0  1.6   .85
   .2   -.26  .23  .22    0  1.6   .07
  -.15   .28  .26  .24    0  .44   .07

  The values on each line define a matrix, vector, and probability:
      matrix   vector  prob
      |a b|     |e|     p
      |c d|     |f|

  The "p" values are the probabilities assigned to each function (how
  often it is used), which add up to one. Fractint supports up to 32
  functions, although usually three or four are enough.

  3D IFS definitions are a bit different.  The name is followed by (3D) in
  the definition file, and each line of the definition contains 13
  numbers: a b c d e f g h i j k l p, defining:
      matrix   vector  prob
      |a b c|   |j|     p
      |d e f|   |k|
      |g h i|   |l|

  The program FDESIGN can be used to design IFS fractals - see FDESIGN
  (p. 203).

  You can save the points in your IFS fractal in the file ORBITS.RAW which
  is overwritten each time a fractal is generated. The program Acrospin
  can read this file and will let you view the fractal from any angle
  using the cursor keys. See Acrospin (p. 203).


 2.16 Sierpinski Gasket

  (type=sierpinski)

  Another pre-Mandelbrot classic, this one found by W. Sierpinski around
  World War I. It is generated by dividing a triangle into four congruent
  smaller triangles, doing the same to each of them, and so on, yea, even
  unto infinity. (Notice how hard we try to avoid reiterating
  "iterating"?)
