     asinh(z) = log(z+sqrt(z*z+1))
     acosh(z) = log(z+sqrt(z*z-1))
     atanh(z) = 1/2 * log((1+z)/(1-z))

     sqr(x+iy) = (x^2-y^2) + i*2xy
     sqrt(x+iy) = sqrt(sqrt(x^2+y^2)) * (cos(atan(y/x)/2) + i sin(atan(y/x)/2))

     ident(x+iy) = x + iy
     conj(x+iy) = x - iy
     recip(x+iy) = (x-iy) / (x^2+y^2)
     flip(x+iy) = y + ix
     zero(x+iy) = 0
     one(x+iy)  = 1
     cabs(x+iy) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
     floor(x+iy) = floor(x) + i*floor(y)
     ceil(x+iy)  = ceil(x) + i*ceil(y)
     trunc(x+iy) = trunc(x) + i*trunc(y)
     round(x+iy) = round(x) + i*round(y)

  Fractint's definitions of abs(x+iy) and |x+iy| below are non-standard.
  Math texts define both absolute value and modulus of a complex number to
  be the same thing.  They are both equal to cabs(x+iy) as defined above.

     |x+iy| = x^2 + y^2
     abs(x+iy) = sqrt(x^2) + i sqrt(y^2)

  Quaternions are four dimensional generalizations of complex numbers.
  They almost obey the familiar field properties of real numbers, but fail
  the commutative law of multiplication, since x*y is not generally equal
  to y*x.

  Quaternion algebra is most compactly described by specifying the rules
  for multiplying the basis vectors 1, i, j, and k. Quaternions form a
  superset of the complex numbers, and the basis vectors 1 and i are the
  familiar basis vectors for the complex algebra. Any quaternion q can be
  represented as a linear combination q = x + yi + zj + wk of the basis
  vectors just as any complex number can be written in the form z = a +
  bi.

  Multiplication rules for quaternion basis vectors:
  ij =  k jk =  i ki = j
  ji = -k kj = -i ik = -j
  ii = jj = kk = -1
  ijk = -1

  Note that ij = k but ji = -k, showing the failure of the commutative law.
  The rules for multiplying any two quaternions follow from the behavior
  of the basis vectors just described. However, for your convenience, the
  following formula works out the details.

  Let q1 = x1 + y1i + z1j + w1k and q2 = x2 + y2i + z2j + w2k.
  Then q1q2 = 1(x1x2 - y1y2 - z1z2 - w1w2) +
              i(y1x2 + x1y2 - w1z2 + z1w2) +
              j(z1x2 + w1y2 + x1z2 - y1w2) +
              k(w1x2 + z1y2 - y1z2 + x1w2)
