  orbit points are plotted individually, but for a negative spacing the
  points are connected.

  This fractal is similar to the Pickover Popcorn (p. 56).
  A variant is the implicit Euler approximation:
           y(n+1) = y(n) + dt*f(x(n))
           x(n+1) = x(n) - dt*f(y(n+1))
  This variant results in complex orbits.  The implicit Euler
  approximation is selected by entering dt&lt;0.

  There are two options that have unusual effects on these fractals.  The
  Orbit Delay value controls how many initial points are computed before
  the orbits are displayed on the screen.  This allows the orbit to settle
  down.  The outside=summ option causes each pixel to increment color
  every time an orbit touches it; the resulting display is a 2-d
  histogram.

  These fractals are discussed in Chapter 14 of Pickover's "Computers,
  Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty".


 2.44 Mandelcloud

  (type=mandelcloud)

  This fractal computes the Mandelbrot function, but displays it
  differently.  It starts with regularly spaced initial pixels and
  displays the resulting orbits.  This idea is somewhat similar to the
  Dynamic System (p. 75).

  This fractal was invented by Noel Giffin.


 2.45 Quaternion

  (type=quat,quatjul)

  These fractals are based on quaternions.  Quaternions are an extension
  of complex numbers, with 4 parts instead of 2.  That is, a quaternion Q
  equals a+ib+jc+kd, where a,b,c,d are reals.  Quaternions have rules for
  addition and multiplication.  The normal Mandelbrot and Julia formulas
  can be generalized to use quaternions instead of complex numbers.

  There is one complication.  Complex numbers have 2 parts, so they can be
  displayed on a plane.  Quaternions have 4 parts, so they require 4
  dimensions to view.  That is, the quaternion Mandelbrot set is actually
  a 4-dimensional object.  Each quaternion C generates a 4-dimensional
  Julia set.
