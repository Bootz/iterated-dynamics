 5.17 Plotter Parameters

  Plotters which understand HP-GL commands are supported. To use a
  plotter, draw a SMALL image (32x20 or 64x40) using the &lt;v&gt;iew screen
  options.  Put a red pen in the first holder in the plotter, green in the
  second, blue in the third.  Now press &lt;P&gt; to start plotting.  Now get a
  cup of coffee...  or two... or three.  It'll take a while to plot.
  Experiment with different resolutions, plot areas, plotstyles, and even
  change pens to create weird-colored images.

  PLOTSTYLE=0|1|2
  0: 3 parallel lines (red/green/blue) are drawn for each pixel, arranged
    like "///".  Each bar is scaled according to the intensity of the
    corresponding color in the pixel.  Using different pen colors (e.g.
    blue, green, violet) can come out nicely.  The trick is to not tell
    anyone what color the bars are supposed to represent and they will
    accept these plotted colors because they do look nice...
  1: Same as 0, but the lines are also twisted.  This removes some of the
    'order' of the image which is a nice effect.  It also leaves more
    whitespace making the image much lighter, but colors such as yellow
    are actually visible.
  2: Color lines are at the same angle and overlap each other.  This type
    has the most whitespace.  Quality improves as you increase the number
    of pixels squeezed into the same size on the plotter.


 5.18 3D Parameters

  To stay out of trouble, specify all the 3D parameters, even if you want
  to use what you think are the default values. It takes a little practice
  to learn what the default values really are. The best way to create a
  set of parameters is to use the &lt;B&gt; command on an image you like and
  then use an editor to modify the resulting parameter file.

  3D=Yes
  3D=Overlay
  Resets all 3d parameters to default values. If FILENAME= is given,
  forces a restore to be performed in 3D mode (handy when used with
  'batch=yes' for batch-mode 3D images). If specified, 3D=Yes should come
  before any other 3d parameters on the command line or in a parameter
  file entry. The form 3D=Overlay is identical except that the previous
  graphics screen is not cleared, as with the &lt;#&gt; (&lt;shift-3&gt; on some
  keyboards) overlay command.  Useful for building parameter files that
  use the 3D overlay feature.

  The options below override the 3D defaults:
  PREVIEW=yes                Turns on 3D 'preview' default mode
  SHOWBOX=yes                Turns on 3D 'showbox' default mode
  COARSE=nn                  Sets Preview 'coarseness' default value
  SPHERE=yes                 Turns on spherical projection mode
  STEREO=n                   Selects the type of stereo image creation
  RAY=nnn                    selects raytrace output file format
  BRIEF=yes                  selects brief or verbose file for DKB output
  USEGRAYSCALE=yes           use grayscale as depth instead of color number
