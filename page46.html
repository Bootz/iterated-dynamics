              screen. Press &lt;n&gt; again to turn off numbers.

  &lt;h&gt;         Hide fractal toggle. Works only if View Windows is turned on
              and set for a small window (such as the default size.) Hides
              the fractal, allowing the orbit to take up the whole screen.
              Press &lt;h&gt; again to uncover the fractal.
  &lt;s&gt;         Saves the fractal, cursor, orbits, and numbers.

  &lt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;.&gt;  Zoom inverse julia image larger.

  The Julia Inverse window is only implemented for the classic Mandelbrot
  (type=mandel). For other "Mandelbrot" types &lt;space&gt; turns on the cursor
  without the Julia window, and allows you to select coordinates of the
  matching Julia set in a way similar to the use of the zoom box with the
  Mandelbrot/Julia toggle in previous Fractint versions.


 2.4 Inverse Julias

  (type=julia_inverse)

  Pick a function, such as the familiar Z(n) = Z(n-1) squared plus C (the
  defining function of the Mandelbrot Set).  If you pick a point Z(0) at
  random from the complex plane, and repeatedly apply the function to it,
  you get a sequence of new points called an orbit, which usually either
  zips out toward infinity or zooms in toward one or more "attractor"
  points near the middle of the plane.  The set of all points that are
  "attracted" to infinity is called the "Basin of Attraction" of infinity.
  Each of the other attractors also has its own Basin of Attraction.  Why
  is it called a Basin?  Imagine a lake, and all the water in it
  "draining" into the attractor.  The boundary between these basins is
  called the Julia Set of the function.

  The boundary between the basins of attraction is sort of like a
  repeller; all orbits move away from it, toward one of the attractors.
  But if we define a new function as the inverse of the old one, as for
  instance Z(n) = sqrt(Z(n-1) minus C), then the old attractors become
  repellers, and the former boundary itself becomes the attractor!  Now,
  starting from any point, all orbits are drawn irresistibly to the Julia
  Set!  In fact, once an orbit reaches the boundary, it will continue to
  hop about until it traces the entire Julia Set!  This method for drawing
  Julia Sets is called the Inverse Iteration Method, or IIM for short.

  Unfortunately, some parts of each Julia Set boundary are far more
  attractive to inverse orbits than others are, so that as an orbit traces
  out the set, it keeps coming back to these attractive parts again and
  again, only occasionally visiting the less attractive parts.  Thus it
  may take an infinite length of time to draw the entire set.  To hasten
  the process, we can keep track of how many times each pixel on our
